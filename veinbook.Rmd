This book is about the process for estimating vehicular emissions. This process
is complex and _can_ be dificult. It is required a big amount of information related to traffic, emissions factors and then process the outpus for the desired purpose. 
In this book this process is addressed with the **VEIN** [@gmd-2017-193] model, 
which is an R package available at https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=vein}.


## Purpose {-}

I wrote this book to provide instructions to all possible users who want to 
estimate vehicular emissions using VEIN. VEIN provides several function which
are related to each other reading different traffic sources and emission factors
for different pollutants. However, incorporating all the functions with
input/output (I/O) process can be difficult. Moreover, communicating the
recommended practices and instructions to a increasingly broader audience
can be more difficult. Therefore, the purpose of this book is to reach the 
maximum amount of interested people in a simple way. The language chosen is
engligh because it is the global language.

## Structure {-}

Chapter \@ref(intro) covers the introduction to this book including the 
installation of R packages and dependent libraries to several operative systems.
Chapter \@ref(basic) covers basics commands using R. Chapter \@ref(st) presents 
the function _inventory_ to produce an structure of directories and scripts 
for runnin vein. Chapter \@ref(traffic) covers the required traffic data for
inputting into VEIN including differenttypes and sources of information.
Chapter \@ref(ef) includes the emission factors that are included into the
package and also, examples for inputing and creating
new emission factors. Chapter \@ref(est) presents the estimations functions and
tips. Chapter \@ref(post) includes the functions to do post-estimations to 
generate emission data-bases and also emissions at each street. Chapter 
 \@ref(he) and \@ref(ep) provides applications into air quality
modeling, some studies with to investigte health effects and lastly, the use of
VEIN as a tool for environmental planning.

# Introduction {#intro}

## Definitions and sources of information

Developing emissions inventories is a complex task. Therefore, before entering 
into the details of the functions, it is good to provide some initial definitions.

A good starting point is the book _"The Art of Emissions Inventorying"_ [@pulles2010art].
This book provides general description of what is an emissions inventory. One of the early
sources of information about emissions inventories and emissions factors is the
Environmental Protection Agency (U.S.EPA) and its compilation of emission factors AP42 (https://www.epa.gov/air-emissions-factors-and-quantification).
A third source of information are the European EMEP/EEA air pollutant emission inventory guidebook (https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/air/emep-eea-air-pollutant-emission-inventory-guidebook/).

An emissions inventory is the compilation of all mass emitted into the atmosphere
by activities in a defined area during a lapse of time. The Eq. (\@ref(eq:efGERAL) shows the
general form [@guia]:

\begin{equation}
Emission_{pollutant}=\sum_{activities} Activity reate \cdot Emission factor_{activity, pollutant}
(\#eq:efGERAL)
\end{equation}

There are two main tpes of inventories based on the application, one type is for policy
application and the other for scientific application [@pulles2010art]. 

- Inventories for policy application include the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory for the parties under the United Nations Framework on Climate Change [@unfccc].
- Emissions inventories with scientific applications include the Emission 
Database for Global Atmospheric Research EDGAR [@edgar].

Emissions inventories can be also multi medi ainventories, such as the Pollutant Release
and Transfer Registers (PRTR) which include pollutants released to air, water and soil 
and transferred off-site for treatment or disposal (http://www.oecd.org/chemicalsafety/pollutant-release-transfer-register/). However,
the type of inventory covered in this book cover only the emissions released into the 
atmosphere.

### Approaches

It is necessary show some definitions of vehicular emissions inventories approaches, 
which in this case comes from the European Emissions Guidelines [@NtziachristosSamaras2016]:

- **Top-down** inventories are uses input activity traffic data as fleet statistics,
fuel consumption, representative speeds and country balances. The emissions factors
uses representative speeds. This inventory are also know as _static_.
- **Bottom-up** Input activity traffic data comes from traffic counts, traffic
simulations, vehicle composition, speed recordings and length of the raods. The
emission factors are speed or/and acceleration functions. These inventories are also 
know as _dynamic_.
- **Reconciliation** Both approaches can be reconciliated in urban emissions inventories
with comparison of total mileage, cold start mileage or emission factors in order
that the comparison with the total fuel consumption on the study area is satisfactory.
This means that bottom-up and top-down vehicular emissions must match the fuel sales
over a region of study. 

## Installation

The VEIN r-package can be installed from Comprehensive R Archive Network 
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) directly:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# CRAN
install.packages("vein")
```

VEIN can be also installed from github:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("ibarraespinosa/vein")
```

The github installation requires that the _devtools_ package [@devtools] must be installes, including
its dependencies.

## Required R packages and dependencies

In order to use the VE0IN package it is necesary to download other r-packages and its dependencies.
The current dependencies of VEIN are:

- **sp**. This is a package that provides clases and methods for spatial data [@sp] considering
points, lines, polygons and grids.
- **rgeos**. It is an interface to the "geometry Engine - Open Source ('GEOS') using the C 'API' for 
topology operations on geometries" [@rgeos]. Depends on the library GEOS (http://trac.osgeo.org/geos). 
- **rgdal**. Provides bindings to the 'Geospatial' Data Abstraction Library ('GDAL') (>= 1.6.3) and 
access to projection/transformation operations from the 'PROJ.4' library [@rgdal]. Depends on the library GDAL
(http://www.gdal.org/) and PROJ (http://proj4.org/).
- **raster**. It is a package that provides tools for analyses and modeling of geographic data [@raster].
- **units**. It i a package dor measurement units in R [@units]. This package depends on the library 
udunits2 (http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/udunits/). I


```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("sp", "rgeos", "rgdal", "raster", "units"))
```


In order to install these package it is necessary to install the dependencies into each operational system.
The instructions are:

**Ubuntu**
```{bash eval=FALSE}
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntugis/ubuntugis-unstable
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libudunits2-dev libgdal-dev libgeos-dev l
ibproj-dev 
```


**Fedora**
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
sudo dnf install gdal-devel proj-devel proj-epsg proj-nad 
geos-devel udunits2-devel
```

**Debian and other**

Dockerfiles from [rocker geospatial](https://github.com/rocker-org/geospatial).

**Windows**
Via [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).

**MAC OS**
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
brew unlink gdal
brew tap osgeo/osgeo4mac && brew tap --repair
brew install proj
brew install geos
brew install udunits
brew install gdal2 --with-armadillo --with-complete 
--with-libkml --with-unsupported
brew link --force gdal2
```

The new version of VEIN wil replace the spatial r-packages dependencies of 
raster, rgeos and rgdal by the new **sf** [@sf] package and the units [@units] package.

sf is a package that provides simple features access for R [@sf], which can be installed
in this way:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("sf")
```

or via devtools

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("r-spatial/sf")
```


## Data inside the VEIN model

There are several datasets available inside the model:

### Emission factors from CETESB

- **fe2015**: Emission factors from Environmental Agency of Sao Paulo (CETESB).
Pollutants included: "CH4", "CO", "CO2", "HC", "N2O", "NMHC", "NOx" and "PM". The
type of vehicles included are Passenger Cars (PC) and 

usage:
```{r}
library(vein, quietly = T)
data(fe2015)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(
    head(fe2015[, c(1:3, 11, 12)], 6), 
  caption = 'Emission factors from CETESB in VEIN model',
  booktabs = TRUE
)
```




### Mileage functions of Brazilian Fleet

- **fkm**: List of functions of mileage in km fro Brazilian fleet. Includes mileage functions
based on more than 2 million recordings of vehicles [@BruniBales2013]. It consists
in a list of age functions. The type of vehicles are Passneger Cars (PC), Light 
Commercial Vehicles (LCV), Small Bus (SBUS), Trucks, Articulated Trucks (ATRUCKS),
Motorcycles (MOTO) and Light vehicles' (LDV). The fuels are Gasoline using 25\% of
ethanol (E25), Ethanol 100\% (E100) and Diesel with 5\% of biodiesel (B5). There are
also vehicles with flex engines which can run either with E25, E100 or any mixture
in between [@2005-01-4130]. The Fig. (\@ref(fig:mil) shows the mileage of PC using fuel E25.


usage:
```{r mil, fig.cap='Mileage of PC using E25', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
library(vein, quietly = T)
data(fkm)
names(fkm)
age <- 1:50
mileage <- fkm[["KM_PC_E25"]](1:50) 
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1))
plot(y = mileage, x = age, pch = 19, type = "b")

```

- **net**: Road network of the west part of Sao Paulo city. It consistes in a 
SpatialLinesDataFrame (class of sp) with the attributes ldv (light duty vehicles, 
$1 \cdot h^{-1}$), hdv (heavy duty vehicles, $1 \cdot h^{-1}$), ps (peak speed, 
$km \cdot h^{-1}$), ffs (free flow speed, $km \cdot h^{-1}$), tstreet (type of street), 
lanes (number of lanes), capacity (capacity fo vehicles at each link, 1/h) and tmin (time
for travelling each link, min). The Fig. (\@ref(traffic) shows more details.



### Temporal factors for Passenger Cars

Temporal factors (TF) are marix of jourly traffic data normalized for the hour
of interest, normally the morning rush hour 08:00-09:00 in local time (LT) [@gmd-2017-193].
This dataset cover 168 hours of one week and it is based on traffic counts
of toll stations near the center of the city of SãoPaulo, Brazil. The Fig.
(\@ref(fig:tf) shows the temporal factors for PC.

usage:
```{r tf, fig.cap='Temporal Factors for PC', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
library(vein, quietly = T)
data(pc_profile)
tf <- unlist(pc_profile)
hours <- 1:168
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1))
plot(y = tf, x = hours, pch = 16, type = "b")
```



### Profile for cold starts of Passenger Cars

This is a profile with the hourly percentage of cold starts of Passenger Cars. This
data covers 24 hours of a working day and it is based cold start recordings during the implementation of the International Vehicle Emissions (IVE) model [@Davisetal2005]
in São Paulo [@ivesp]. The Fig. (\@ref(fig:cold) shows the cold-start profile.

usage:
```{r cold, fig.cap='Cold-starts profile for PC', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
library(vein, quietly = T)
data(pc_cold)
cold <- unlist(pc_cold)
hours <- 1:24
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1))
plot(y = cold, x = hours, pch = 16, type = "b")
```

# Basics of R {#basic}

## Brief history

R is a programming language developed by Ross Ihaka and Robert Genleman in 1993 
[@ihaka1996r]. A good resource about R is the book  programming for data science 
[@peng2015r]. R can be explained as a free version of S-PLUS programming 
language (http://www.solutionmetrics.com.au/products/splus/default.html). It is 
free and recognized a GNU spftware (https://www.gnu.org/software/software.html)
with GNU General Public License (GPLV2-GPLV3) license. This feature allowed that many 
developers started improving and adding code over the years. 

R includes several statistical functions, therefore, user who just want to use 
the base capabilities of R are not forced to learn R-programming. However, the evolution from user to developer in R has been facilitated with numerous
publications such as the book "R packages: organize, test, document, and share
your code" [@wickham2015r], or "The art of R programming: A tour of statistical software  design" [@matloff2011art]. 

### Installation

R can be installed in different OS including Linux, Windows, Mac and Solaris. 
The webpage https://cran.r-project.org/ shows how to install R in any platform.
A popular Integrated development environment (IDE) is **RStudio** https://www.rstudio.com/, which contains many useful integrated options. 
However, R can be run on the terminal and use any text editor to write scripts.

## Using R

If we type at the R promt 
```{r}
x <- 1   # Not printing  results
x        # Print results
print(x) # Explicit print x
```

Rhe integer 1 was _assigned_ (<-) to x, then writing x or print(x) will show
the value of x. Instead of numbers, can be assigned other expressions
such as strings, dates or other objects. R includes several statistical 
functions. For instance, if we type 'pi' at the terminal, it will print
the pi number.

```{r}
pi
```

### R objects

There are five basic classes (or atomic classes).

- character.
- numeric.
- integer.
- complex.
- logical (TRUE/FALSE or just T or F).

Objects of the same class can be grouped in **vectors**. Vectors are created with 
writting **c()** with the elements of the vector inside the parenthesis, separated
by colon. In fact, **c** is a builtin function to create vectors. In this case,
the vector v1 contain a sequence of three integers, from 1 to 3. The resulting 
class is numeric.

```{r}
v1 <- 1:3
v2 <- c(1, 2, 3)
identical(v1, v2)
v1
class(v1)
```

With the operator `[` we can get specific elements of your vectors. In the 
following code it is also used the function `length`, which simply returns
the length of an object.

```{r}
v1[1]          # first element of v1
v1[length(v1)] # last element element of v1
```


If we create a vector with numbers and letter, the resulting vector will
be "character" converting the numbers in characters.

```{r}
v2 <- c(1:3,"a")
v2
class(v2)
```

Objects can be converted to other classes with the "as.*" functions. For instance,
If we convert the vector v2 to numeric, it will recognize the numbers adding an 
`r NA` into the position of the character.

```{r}
as.numeric(v2)
```


### Factors

Factors represents categorical data. A typical example is a character vector of
days of the week. The function `factor` creates factors, to see help type 
`?factor`. The following example will use this function with the arguments `x`
and `levels`. 

```{r}
dow <- factor(x = c("Wednesday", "Monday", "Thursday", "Friday"),
              levels =  c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday",
                          "Friday"))
dow
```

### Missing Values

Missing values in data-sets are a typical source of headache in r users. 
Fortunatly, R counts with several tools to avoid these headaches. These tools
are fhe functions `is.na` to check for NA (not available) and `is.nan` (not
a number). This functions returns logical values.

```{r}
n <- c(1, NA)
is.na(n)
n <- c(1, NaN)
is.na(n)
is.nan(n)
```


### Matrices

Matrices are structure with rows and columns. They can be created using the 
`matrix` function and also, using vectors. Remember, if you want to know more
about any function you just have to type ? and function, for instance:`?matrix`
will open the help documentation for the function `matrix`. Let's create a
matrix using vectors:

```{r}
a <- 1:12  #numeric vector
(m <- matrix(data = a, nrow = 3, ncol = 4))
```

We can check the dimensions of our matrix `m` with `dim`, which are 3 and 4.

```{r}
dim(m)
```

In order to get the elements of matrix `m` we can use `[` operator:
```{r}
m[1, 1] # first element
m[, 1]  # firs column
m[1, ]  # firs row
m[3,4]  # last element
```


### Arrays

Arrays are like matrices inside other matrices. In fact, a matrix is a 
2-dimensional array. Let's create an array create an array using the same vector
a and same dimensiones of m, 3 and 4. `array` has three arguments, `data`, `dim`
 and `dimnames`. In th argument `dim` let's add the number 2, resulting
 in an array of two matrices identical to `m`.

```{r}
(a <- array(data = a, dim = c(3,4,2)))
```


We can subset elements from array also with the `[` operator.

```{r}
a[1, 1, 1] # first element
dim(a)     # dimensions
a[3, 4, 2] # last element
```

### Lists

List are objects that can contain elements of different classes. I like to call
lists as bags. In a bag you can put almost anything. Also, inside the bag,
you can put other bags with different things. This means that you can have a
list of lists of any R object. Lists can be created with the `list` function.
Let's create an empty list. Then we will use the vecctor `a` to create another
list.

```{r}
a <- 1:3          # vector of three elements
l1 <- list()      # empty list
l1 <- list(a)     # vector of three elements
length(l1)        # length 1
l1 <- as.list(a)  # vector a as list
length(l1)        # three elements 
```

As mentioned, the list can have lists inside.

```{r}
l1 <- list(list(a),                    # three numeric elements
            list(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE))   # three logical elements
length(l1)                             # length 2
```

### Data-Frames

"Data-frames are used to store tabular data in R" [@peng2015r]. You can think
in data-frames as spreadsheet-like objects. They are similar with matrix and
you can have a matrix and a data-frame with the same dimensions. Basically,
you have rows and columns, columns can have different classes, and the columns
usually have a one-word name.

As this type of object is very used by scientists, there are R packages created
to work with this type of ojects. Below some of them:

- `data.frame`: This is not a package, for a class and function from the `base`.
With this functionyou can create data-frames.
- `data-table` [@datatable]: `data.tables` objects has the class `data.table` 
which inherits from the class `data-frame`, which means that they share common 
characteristics. However, the big difference with `data-table` is the efficiency
with memory. It includes function such as `fread` for reading millions of 
observations in seconds.
- `tidyr`[@tidyr]: Sometimes your data is in long format and you need it in wide
format, and viceversa. This package does the job.
- `readxl` [@readxl]: Good package for importing Excel and LibreOffice files. I
recommend  this packages for newbies.
- `sf` [@sf]: This package presents the class `sf` and introduce the list-column
of spatial geometry.

Let's create a data-frame.

```{r}
a <- 1:3
b <- 3:5
(ab <- data.frame(a, b))
class(ab)
```


### Names

In R you can put names in almost everything. Below examples for `vectors`, 
`matrix` and `data.frames`.

```{r}
names(ab)                # original names
names(ab) <- c("c", "d")
names(ab)                # new names
```

## Inputting data into R

Your data can be in different formats. In this sections i will show you how you
can input text and comma separated values files, which is a very common task. 
Let's say that you uses an spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel or
LibreOffice. Then you might want to export your data into R.

- Your first check if the first row of your data has name or not. If they do
have names, this means that they have a header.
- Then click on 'Save as' and search text file with extension .txt or CSV.
- Then you your file with a note bloc, gedit  or other tool to check if the
decimal character is point '.' and the separator character is comma ',' or 
semicolon ';' or other character. This depends on the regional confugarion of 
your spreadsheet software.
- If your file has extension '.txt', use `read.table` and if is '.csv', use
`read.csv`.

Once you check, you can import your '.txt' or '.csv' files in R:

```{r eval = FALSE}
a <- read.csv("path/to/file.csv", sep = ",", header = T)
a <- read.tablesv("path/to/file.txt", sep = ",", header = T)
```

# Structuring an Emissions Inventory {#st}

The description file of vein says:

Elaboration of vehicular emissions inventories, consisting in four stages,

1. pre-processing activity data,
1. preparing emissions factors,
1. estimating the emissions and
1. post-processing of emissions in maps and databases.

This means that vein provide functions to be used in each of the stages. However,
in order follow these stages it is needed a structure of directories with
scripts with vein functions. Therefore, it was created the function
`inventory`, to create this structure.

```


## The `inventory` function

The inventory function creates creates a structure of directories and scripts
to run vein. This structure is a suggestion and the user can use any other.
The following code shows the arguments of the function. This is done using
the base function `args` with `inventory`.

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(vein)
```

```{r}
args(inventory)
```

The arguments are `name`, `vehcomp`, `scripts`, `show.dir`, `show.scripts` and
`clear`.

- The argument `name`

name is a word to be used as main directory where directories and scripts are
stored in. It consists in *one* word with ascii characters. It is also
recommended to be used without any special character or accents, for instance:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
name = file.path(tempdir(), "YourCity")
inventory(name = name, show.dir = TRUE, show.scripts = TRUE)
```


- The argument `vehcomp`

This argument is very important and comes from _Vehicular Composition_, which is
the classification of the fleet by type of use, type of fuel, size of engine and
gross weight, based on definitions of @Corvalanetal2002. There is also the
_technological composition_ of the fleet which relates the technological
modifications of the car in order to accomplish the emissions standards. However,
in vein uses a distribution by age of use as \@ref(traffic) shows.

The vehicular composition `vehcomp` has 5 types of vehicles:

1. Passenger Carss (PC).
1. Light Commercial Vehicles (LCV). 
1. Heavy Good Vehicles or trucks (HGV).
1. Buses (BUS).
1. Motorcycles (MC).

The default value of this argument is: `c(PC = 1, LCV = 1, HGV = 1, BUS = 1, MC = 1)`, 
which means that there are 1 types of PC, 1 of LCV, 1 of trucks, 1 of buses and
1 types of motorcycles. This vehicular composition is only for ilutrasting that
the user can chnge these values according its own data. Appendix B
shows the vehicular composition from the vehicular emissions inventory of the 
Environmental Agency of São Paulo, Brazil [@CETESB2015]. In Brazil, the fuel used 
in vehicles is blended with ethanol with and biodiesel. The user can use **any** vehicular composition that representes its fleet with up-to 99 type of vehicles per
category. For instance, if there are 4 types of PC in a fleet, `PC = 4`, and
each one has a age of use distribution.


- The argument `show.dir`

This is a logical argument to decide if the output of the function will return
print the new directories or not. The use is:

```{r}
name = file.path(tempdir(), "YourCity")
inventory(name = name, show.dir = TRUE, show.scripts = FALSE)
```

`inventory` creates the direcrory "YourCity" and the sub directories: daily,
ef, emi, est, images, network and veh.

- **daily**: it is for storing the profiles saved as .csv files. For instance,
`data(pc_profile)` is a matrix than could be saved as .csv.
- **ef**: it is for storing the emission factors data-frame, similar to
`data(fe2015)` but including one column for each of the categories of the
vehicular composition. For instance, if PC = 5, there should be 5 columns with
emission factors in this file. If LCV = 5, another 5 columns should be present,
and so on.
- **emi**: Directory with subdirectories matching the vehicular composition for
saving the estimates. It is suggested to use .rds extension instead of .rda.
- **est**: Directory with subdirectories matching the vehicular composition for
for storing the scripts named `input.R`. 
- **images**: Directory for saving images.
- **network**: Directory for saving the road network with the required
attributes. This file will include the vehicular flow per street to be used by functions `age_ldv`,  `age_hdv`,  `age_moto` or `my_ldv`.
- **post**: Directory for storing the processed emissions. It includes the
directories **df** for emissions by age of use, hou and other parameters,
**streets** for storing the total emissions by streets and **grids** for storing
total gridded emissions by pollutant.
- **veh**: Directory for storing the distribution by age of use of each category
of the vehicular composition. Those are data-frames with number of columns with
the age distribution and the number of rows as the number of streets. The class
of these objects is "Vehicles".


devt
- The argument `scripts`

This argument adds scripts into the directories. The default is TRUE. The type
of scrits create are:

- main.R: Adds the `setwd("YourCity")`, `library(vein)`, `source(traffic.R)`,
some comments and a loop for source all inputs. It is recommended not using
the loop till it is certain that all scripts are correct.
- traffic.R: Includes two lines with exampmles of how to use the `age_ldv`
function and saving the output in the directory veh.
- input.R: Each file has the scripts for reading the network, vehicles, emission
factors and estimating emissions.

- The argument `show.scripts`

This argument prints the scripts created:

```{r}
name = file.path(tempdir(), "YourCity")
inventory(name = name, show.dir = FALSE, show.scripts = TRUE)
```

- The argument `clear`

This is a logical argument that deletes recursively when TRUE, or not when FALSE,
the directory and created another one. Default is TRUE.

The following chapters show the use of other vein functions inside an structure
of directories and scripts with the name `inventory("YourCity")`.

# Traffic data {#traffic}

Traffic data is read in VEIN as spatial information. In other words, traffic data
must in any vectorial line spatial format with the drivers provided by the 
library **GDAL** (http://www.gdal.org/ogr_formats.html) called by the packages
**rgdal** or **sf**. This means that traffic data must in in any GDAL spatial
format. The Eq. \@ref(eq:flow) show how traffic data is treated into vein. 

\begin{equation}
F^*_{i,j,k} = Q_{i} \cdot VC_{i,j} \cdot Age_{j,k}
(\#eq:flow)
\end{equation}

where $F^*_{i,j,k}$ is the vehicular flow at street link $i$ for vehicle type $j$ by
age of use $k$. $j$ defines the vehicular composition according to their type of 
use, type of fuel, size of engine and gross weight, based on definitions of
[@Corvalanetal2002]. $Q_i$ is the traffic flow at street link $i$. $VC_{i,j}$ is
the fraction of vehicles varying according to the type of vehicles $j$ in the
composition for street link $i$.  $Age_{j,k}$ is the age distribution by vehicular
composition $j$ and age of use $k$. This Equation shows that $VC$ splits the total
vehicular flow $Q$ to identify the vehicular fraction, which varies according to the
type of fuel, size of motor and gross weight. For example, if $Q$ is light duty
vehicles (LDV) and it is known that 5\% of the $Q$ are passenger cars (PC), with
engine lesser than 1400 cc, $VC$ is 0.05. This characterization of the fleet depends
on the amount and quality of the available information. VEIN then multiplies the
traffic with $Age$ to obtain the amount of each type of vehicle by age of use. 


## Sources of traffic data

### Travel demand outputs

VEIN was developepd according to the available traffic data in São Pauo, Brazil.
In this case, the available data was a 4-stage macroscopic travel
model for morning rush hour and hourly traffic counts for morning and evening
rush hours. The travel model is based on data from an Origin-Destination-Survey 
(ODS) [@ODS] which started in the decade of 1950 in São Paulo. A classic reference 
of a 4-stage modeling transport is [@OrtuzarWillumsen2002]. The 4 stages of the 
traffic modeling includes characterization of trip attractions and productions by
zone in some regions, distribution of these trips, preferred mode of transport for
traveling and finally the allocation of the trips at each mode, in this case into
the road network. The ODS is made every 10 years by Metro (http://www.metro.sp.gov.br/),
which is the underground company, and they perform a smaller update of ODS after
5 years. The information gathered in the ODS is massive with the participation of
thousands of commuters. It helps to identify characteristics of the trips inside
MASP. CET uses the information from ODS and performs the traffic simulation. In
this case, it is a macro or strategic traffic simulation which represents the
equilibrium between offer and supply of transportation at maximum load of the
road network, that is, at the rush hour, which is from 08:00 to 09:00 Local Time (LT).

VEIN incorporates an extract of a traffic model simulation for the west part of
São Paulo named *net*. The Fig. (\@ref(fig:ldv) shows the traffic of Light Duty
Vehicles (LDV). This data covers the surrounding area of the University of São
Paulo. The information obtained from CET consists in:

- _ldv_: Light Duty Vehicles (1/h).
- _hdv_: Heavy Duty Vehicles (1/h).
- _lkm_: Length of the link (km).
- _ps_: Peak Speed (km/h).
- _ffs_: Free Flow Speed (km/h).
- _tstreet_: Type of street.
- _lanes_: Number of lanes per link.
- _capacity_: Capacity of vehicles in each link (1/h).
- _tmin_: Time for travelling each link (min).

The following scripts show how to load this data in R. This data has the class
"SpatialLinesDataFrame" from the package [@sp]. This data was converted into
an spatial feature "sf" object [@sf] because it consists in a data-frame with a
list-column of geometry with the spatial attributes and it is easier to handle
than an object class of sp. As entioned, future versions of VEIN will migrate
to sf.

The user must call the library vein first, then load the data net. The object
net has the class "SpatialLinesDataFrame". This data can be seen loaded in R as:

```{r}
library(vein)
library(sp)
data(net)
class(net)
```

The Fig. (\@ref(fig:ldv)) shows that traffic is concentrated in mains streets
such as motorway Marginal Pinheiros, located at the north east part of the area. 

```{r ldv, fig.cap='LDV at 08:00-09:00 (LT) in west São Paulo', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
library(vein)
data(net)
net$ldv <- as.numeric(net$ldv)
spplot(net, "ldv", scales = list(draw = T),
       col.regions = rev(bpy.colors(16)))
```

### Inteprolation of traffic counts

Travel model simulation are not always available and the user interested in
estimating vehicular emisisons with a bottom-up approach would have to look
for alternatives to obtain traffic data at street level. These alternatives
covers interpolating traffic data for different temporal resolutions. For
instance, -@requia developed a vehicular bottom-up inventory using traffic
counts and a geostatistic method called Global Moran's I test [@anselin]. It 
measures the spatial autocorrelation. However, this technique requires that the
observed values are normal, which is not the case for count data.

Other authors were instested in predicting Anual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) or
only ADT. -@lowry2014spatial presented a new method for predicting AADT based on
the concept of origin-destination centrality. The idea is to obtain predictor
variables directly from the road network. He identified origin and destination
zones and added multiplication factors based on the land-use characteristics.

-@zhao2001contributing tested several multiple stepwise regressions incorporating
land-use characteristics. They considered several variables: number of lanes,
classificatiion of road type, employment numbers and access to expressway with
correlations between 0.66 and 0.82. -@lam2000estimation compared neural networks
and regressions for a dataset of 13 locations. Kriging methods were used in AADT
interpolation by -@eom2006improving, who predicted AADT for non-motorway streets.
Also, -@selby2013spatial compared Kriging and geographically weighted regressions
in the prediction of AADT.

Another approach is to perform a spatial regression based on the distributio
on the oberved data. As the data is counts of traffic, a poisson, quasi-poisson
or negative binomial regressions can be used [@zeileis2008regression]. Recently,
-@Ibarraetal2017a compared quasi-posson and negative binomial regresions
predicting hourly traffic data, with better results with quasi-poisson approach
and correlation of 0.72.

Newer approaches involves using GPS data from smart phones and cars. 

### Generating traffic flows from Origin-Destination-Surveys (ODS)

The origin destination survey (ODS) is an important tool which quantifies the 
amount of trips generated in the study area. ODS studies started decades ago. The
oldest ODS paper on Google Scholar is entitles "FUNCTIONS OF A HIGHWAY-PLANNING SURVEY DEPARTMENT" by W. J. Sapp in 1938 at the TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL ROAD SCHOOL
[@sapp1938runctions]. In this paper it is discussed the importance information
for the trffic engineer, and Sapp even mentios: "The engineer must have the supporting data available to substantiate his decisions."

Other study of 1942 shows talks about the importance of traffic counts, disucssing
the elaboration of an origin destination survey where 8000 Boy Scouts of America
participated counting traffic. The method for analyzing the data consisted in
countign the vehicles identifying the licence plate in order to determine the
origin (the first time the vehicle was recorded), the route of vehicles, the
destination and the approximate time for the trip.

After those pioneer studies many many other studies went deeper into the subject. 
And after that, with the irruption of new technologies, new software, use of 
smarthphones with GPS, satellites and big technological centers own by companies 
such as Google (http://www.google.com), new ways for characterizing trips were
developed. In this section i will briefly mention the Google Distance Matrix 
(https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/), the
pgRouting library [@patrushev2007shortest] for postGIS and will expand with two R
packages, googleway [@googleway] and dodgr [@dodgr].

The ODS will provide us the matrix of pairs of zones origin and destinations by 
mode of transport. Then, we can use any of the mentiones softwares to find the
shortest path between each zone. The table \@ref(tab:ods) shows an extraction of 
the OD matrix for the Metropolitan Area of São Paulo (MASP) in 2007 for motorized individual trips. The fig \@ref(fig.zod) shows a map with the location of the zones OD.

```{r ods,  echo = FALSE}
m <- read.csv("figuras/Tab32_OD2007_individual_PICO.csv", h = F, sep = ";")
m <- as.matrix(m[101:110,101:110])
knitr::kable(m, 
             caption = 'Matrix OD for motorized indivitual trips between 06:30 and 08:30 MASP 2007',
             booktabs = TRUE,
             align = "c"
)
```


```{r zod, fig.cap='Zones OD for MASP 2007', out.width='100%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, messages = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
zod <- sf::st_read("figuras/od.shp", quiet = T)
plot(zod$geometry, axes = T, main = NULL)
```

Now, as we know the the trips between each pair of OD zones, we can find the
routes that connectes them. A used algorithm is the shortest path, which connects
two nodes minimizing the total travel time. There are several algorithms, 
including -@dijkstra1959note.

#### Google Distance Matrix API

This we servise allow to "retrieve duration and distance values based on the
recommended route between start and end points." It returns durations and
distance, it is possible to choose modes of transport and even to choose between
current or historial times. The first step is to get a KEY.

If you browser

```{bash eval = FALSE}
https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/distancematrix/json?units=imperial&origins=Washington,DC&destinations=New+York+City,NY&key=YOUR_API_KEY
```

and replace YOUR_API_KEY you will see (my brower is in portuguese):

```{bash eval = FALSE}
{
  "destination_addresses" : [ "Nova York, NY, EUA" ],
  "origin_addresses" : [ "Washington, D.C., Distrito de Columbia, EUA" ],
  "rows" : [
    {
      "elements" : [
        {
          "distance" : {
            "text" : "225 mi",
            "value" : 361972
          },
          "duration" : {
            "text" : "3 horas 53 minutos",
            "value" : 13964
          },
          "status" : "OK"
        }
        ]
    }
    ],
  "status" : "OK"
}
```

The modes of transport covered are **driving** using the road network, 
**walking** via pedestrian paths & sidewalks, **bicycling** via bicycle paths and
**transit** via public transit routes. For more information read the 
documentation.

#### pgRouting for postGIS

pgRouting (http://pgrouting.org/) is an open source routing library for postGIS.
It provides many routing algorithms and it can be run via QGIS 
(https://www.qgis.org). This library is very extensive. A good resource is the
book "pgRouting: A Practical Guide" (http://locatepress.com/pgrouting).

#### The R package googleway

googleway [@googleway] R package allows to access Goolge Maps API https://developers.google.com/maps/.
The API functions are:

- Directions - `google_directions()`
- Distance Matrix - `google_distance()`
- Elevation - `google_elevation()`
- Geocoding - `google_geocode()`
- Reverse Geocoding - `google_reverse_geocode()`
- Places - `google_places()`
- Place Details - `google_place_details()`
- Time zone - `google_timezone()`
- Roads - `google_snapToRoads()` and `google_nearestRoads()`

This package allows to plot over Google Maps. 

```{r}
library(googleway)
## not specifying the api will add the key as your 'default'
key <- "my_api_key"
set_key(key = key)
google_keys()
```

From zone Luz 7, coordinates long -46.63461 and lat  -23.53137 to zone 8 Bom 
Retiro coordinates -46.64482 -23.52204 there are 133 LDV trips between 6:30 and
08:30. We first create the data-frame. This data is based on OD from São Paulo.

```{r }
mydf <- data.frame(region = 1,
                   from_lat = -23.53137,
                   from_long = -46.634613,
                   to_lat = -23.52204,
                   to_long = -46.64482)
```


```{r echo=FALSE}
mykey <- "AIzaSyDQJfIQUR-XzpC8Mmg8XNbFQE5rNp9DAgE"
```

Then we use the package `googleway` to create the points between origin and
destination and maptools to transform points to lines.

```{r  warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
library(maptools, quietly = T)
library(googleway)
foo <- google_directions(origin = unlist(mydf[1, 2:3]),
                         destination = unlist(mydf[1, 4:5]),
                         key = mykey,
                         mode = "driving",
                         simplify = TRUE)
pl <- decode_pl(foo$routes$overview_polyline$points)
df <- sf::st_as_sf(pl, coords = c("lon", "lat"), crs = 4326)
streets <- list(x = pl$lon, y = pl$lat)
streets <- map2SpatialLines(streets)
plot(streets, axes = T, main= "Route of 133 LDV trips")
```

```{r fgwecho= FALSE, fig.cap="Driving route between zones 'Luz' and 'Bom Retiro' in São Paulo"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figuras/gway.png")
```


#### The R package dodgr

dpdgr[@dodgr] is a new R package with great capbilities. It calculates the 
distance on dual-weight graphs  using priority-queue shorest paths. In order 
to calculate the traffic flows it is necessary the matrix OD for the desired 
mode of transport and the coorodinates of centroids of the OD zones.

The function `dodgr_streetnet` uses the osmdata r package to download street 
network data from Open Street Map [@osm] for the points of the centroids of 
zones OD. Depending on the spatial extent of the data, the  resulting data can 
be large. The function `weight_streetnet` weight the lines from OSM road network 
according to a specific profile of traffic: "psv" for Public Service Vehicle.
"bicycle", nd others. The weights are profile values for the OSM type of roads 
based on this webpage: https://www.routino.org/xml/routino-profiles.xml. The
function `dodgr_vertices` extract the vertices pf thegraph including the 
coordinates. Finally, the function `dodgr_flowmap` reads the graph and plot the 
flows. Belows s an example for São Paulo using the data of ODS the urban uderground 
public transportation system [@ODS].


```{r eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
library(dodgr)
library(magrittr)
xy <- sf::st_read("ZonesODS2007/Zonas2007.TAB",
                  crs = 31983) %>% sf::st_transform(4326) %>%
  sf::st_centroid() %>% sf::st_coordinates()
mm <- read.csv("Tab24_OD2007_coletivo.csv", h = F, sep = ";")
m <- as.matrix(mm)
net <- dodgr_streetnet(pts = xy)
netmc <- weight_streetnet(net,
                          wt_profile = "psv")
verts <- dodgr_vertices (netmc)
pts <- verts$id[match_pts_to_graph(verts, xy)]
netf <- dodgr_flows_aggregate(netmc,
                              from = pts,
                              to = pts,
                              flows = m)

dodgr_flowmap(netm)
```

```{r rdodgr, echo = FALSE, include=TRUE, fig.cap="Daily trips of Light Duty Vehicles in São Paulo", dpi=300, fig.height=18, fig.width=18, fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figuras/dodgr.png", dpi = 300)
```


### Top-down approach

VEIN was designed with traffic flow at street leve on mind, however, it is possible
that user might be inclined for doing for using a top-down approach. Here some
possible causes:

1. Bottom-up approach can demand more computatonal resources for a country or a continent. 
2. Another possibility is that the emissions inventory is going to be used solely for air quality modellign purposes, where the proportion of grid spacing and street is such that spatial detail would be lose, for instance with resolution of 10 km.
3. Also, it is possible that there is no way of obtaining traffic information at street level.
4. Limitated resources, time, funding, human resources, etc.
5. Lastly, due to simplism. It is also possible that the objective simply the 
objective is to estimate an emissions inventory using a top-down approach.

Under these circumstances a top-down approach would be better suited for some users.
As VEIN counts toolkit for estimating emissions, it is reasonable to use all VEIN
resources with a top-down approach.

In this case, the user must follow some considerations:

- Use `inventory` functions in the same way as shown on section \@ref(st).
- Create a network, but instead use a road network with spatial lines, use
spatial polygons. The Spatial polygon might represent some area where the amount
of vehicles is known.
- The `age` functions shown in following sections, show that it is possible to 
apply age distributions to each street, in this case, to each area.

The Fig. \@ref(fig:ftd) shows the emissions of PM for each state Brazil and 
prepared for a congress using VEIN as a top-down tool [@ibarraigac].

```{r ftd, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Emissions of PM due trafifc, 2017"}
UF <- readRDS("figuras/net_pollutant.rds")
plot(UF["PM"], axes = T, main = "Emissions of PM due trafifc, 2017")
```





## Main functions

The Fig.(\@ref(fig:diavein)) shows a complete diagram with the steps for
elaborating an emissions inventory. Also, the function `inventory` shown on
sub-section (\@ref(veinstructure)) shows the functions to structure an inventory.
This and the following subsection of application shows respective the part of the
diagram Fig.(\@ref(fig:diatraffic)) and how to run vein storing the results in the 
directories shown on Fig. (\@ref(st)). 

The first element that the user must have is the traffic at street level. This
is shown as a green circle with the word 'traffic' on Fig. (\@ref(fig:diatraffic)).
The user must use any `age` function which produces objects of class `Vehicles`.
The function `netspeed` produces an object of class `Speed`. This objects are
required by the `emis` function.

### Expanding traffic data with the function `temp_fact`

Traffic data must be temporally extrapolated because it is usually available only for the morning rush hour. 
Traffic data can be estimated from short period traffic count datasets, then expanded to represent longer timespan, such as Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT; [@wang2009forecasting, lam2000estimation]). The next step is to extrapolate the vehicular flow at street link $i$, vehicle type $j$, and age of use $k$, to obtain the vehicular flow for hour of the week $l$ ($F_{i,j,k,l}$; see equation 
\@ref(eq:flowx).

\begin{equation}
F_{i,j,k,l} = F^*_{i,j,k} \cdot TF_{j,l}
(\#eq:flowx)
\end{equation}

where $TF_{j,l}$ are the temporal factors varying according  to each hour of
$l$ and type of vehicle $j$.  For instance, $TF$ is defined as a matrix with 24 lines 
and numbers of columns to each day considered, from Monday to Sunday. In order to 
expand traffic to other hours, $TF$ matrices must be normalized to the hour that 
represents the traffic data. It means that $TF$ values at morning peak hour must be 1 
and the respective proportion must be assigned to the other hours. For example, $TF$ values can be obtained from automatic traffic count stations. 

The function `temp_fact` return $F_{i,j,k,l}$ as an object with class `Vehicles`.
The arguments are:

- `q` is a  data-frame of traffic flow to each hour (veh/h) at each street.
- `pro` s a matrix or data-frame to extrapolate .



### Calculating speed at other hours with the function `netspeed`

The average speed of traffic flow is very important and it must be determined for 
each link and hour. Once the vehicular flow is identified for each hour, the 
average speed is then identified for each hour. This was accomplished by employing 
curves from the Bureau of Public Roads (BPR; [@bpr]), as shown in Eq. 
\@ref(eq:bpr). The process involves calculating speed by dividing the length of 
road by the time. The time is calculated using the total traffic expanded to each 
street link $i$ and hour $l$. 

\begin{equation}
T_{i,l} = To_i \cdot \left(1 +\alpha \cdot \left(\dfrac{Q_{i,l}}{C_i}\right)^\beta \right)
(\#eq:bpr)
\end{equation}

The function `netspeed` do this calculations. The arguments of this function
are:

```{r}
args(netspeed)
```

`netspeed` allows basically two types of speeds data-frame which depends on the
availability od data by the user. If the user has `q`, `ps`, `ffs` and `cap` can
use the argument `scheme = FALSE`, or when the user only has `ps` and `ffs`
and use the argument `scheme = TRUE`.

- `q` is a  data-frame of traffic flow to each hour (veh/h) at each street.
- `ps	`is the Peak speed (km/h) at each street.
- `ffs` Free flow speed (km/h) at each street.
- `cap` Capacity of link (veh/h) at each street.
- `lkm` Distance of link (km) of each street.
- `alpha` Parameter of -@bpr curves.
- `beta` Parameter of -@bpr curves.
- `scheme` Logical to create a Speed data-frame with 24 hours and a default profile. It needs `ffs` and `ps` at each street:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
df <- data.frame(
  Period = c("00:00-06:00",
             "06:00-07:00",
             "07:00-10:00",
             "10:00-17:00",
             "17:00-20:00",
             "20:00-22:00",
             "22:00-00:00"),
  Speed = c("ffs (Free flow speed)",
            "average between ffs and ps",
            "ps (Peakspeed)",
            "average between ffs and ps",
            "ps (Peak speed)",
            "average between ffs and ps",
            "ffs (Free flow speed)"))
knitr::kable(df, 
             caption = 'speeds for scheme = T',
             booktabs = TRUE,
             align = "c"
)
```


### Distribution of vehicles by age of use with the functions `age_ldv`, `age_hdv` and `age_moto`


These functions reads traffic data at each street and returns an object of class
`Vehicles`, which is a data-frame with the number of vehicles at each street
and the number of columns represent the amount of vehicles at each age. The
functions `age_moto` and `age_hdv` are identical. These functions apply survival
equations into the fleet from -@MMA2011. The arguments are:

- `x`numerical vector of vehicles at each street.
- `name` word of vehicle assigned to columns of dataframe.
- `a` parameter of survival equation. The default value for `age_ldv` is 1.698
and for `age_hdv` and `age_moto` is 0.2.
- `b` parameter of survival equation.  The default value for `age_ldv` is -0.2
and for `age_hdv` and `age_moto` is 17.
- `agemin` age of newest vehicles for that category. The default value is 1,
however it can be bigger than one when it is a vehicle that is not circulating
more than year ago.
- `agemax` age of oldest vehicles for that category. Teh default value is 50
assuming that the oldest vehicle in circulation has 50 years of use. However,
new type of vehicles will be newer.
- `k` multiplication factor. This factor helps to split the traffic `x` in the
vehicular composition.
- `bystreet` when TRUE it is expecting that `a` and `b` are numeric vectors with length equal to `x`. In other words, the values of `a` and `b` varies in each
street.
- `message` message with average age and total number of vehicles.


### The function `my_age`

These functions also reads traffic data at each street and returns an object of
class `Vehicles`, which is a data-frame with the number of vehicles at each
street and the number of columns represent the amount of vehicles at each age.
However, it is based on data the user has and not by parameters. Therefore,
using this function with own data should produce more representative results.
The arguments are:

```{r}
args(my_age)
```

- `x` numerical vector of vehicles at each street.
- `y` Age dustribution of vehicles. This parameter can be anual sales or anual 
registry for the category of vehicle.
- `name` of vehicle assigned to columns of dataframe.
- `k` multiplication factor. This factor helps to split the traffic `x` in the
vehicular composition.
- `message` message with average age and total numer of vehicles.


### The class `Vehicles`

`Vehicles` is a class in vein, shown in on Fig. (\@ref(fig:diatraffic)). This
class includes the methods `print`, `plot` and `summary`. This means that, 
`Vehicles` objects presents customized versions of  `print`, `plot` and
`summary` in order to make easier to the user to use vein. The figure
\@ref(fig.plotpc) shows a simple plot of a `Vehicles` object, followed by the
`head` of this object. The plot shows the sum of each type of vehicle by age of use, 
with a vertical red line indicating the average age, 11.17 years of use.

```{r plotpc, echo = TRUE}
library(vein)
data(net)
PC_E25 <- age_ldv(x = net$ldv,name = "PC_E25", k = 75/100*37.25, message = F)
plot(PC_E25)
```


```{r headpc, echo = TRUE}
head(PC_E25[, 1:4]) # The first 4 columns
```


### Other traffic functions

Another function is `adt` which calculates average daily traffic (ADT) from
hourly traffic data. This function reads numeric vectors with the amount of
vehicles at each street expand the traffic with temporal factors for each type
of vehicle. The arguemtns are:

```{r}
args(adt)
```

- `pc` numeric vector for passenger cars
- `lcv` numeric vector for light commercial vehicles
- `hgv` numeric vector for heavy good vehicles or trucks
- `bus` numeric vector for bus
- `mc` numeric vector for motorcycles
- `p_pc` data-frame profile for passenger cars
- `p_lcv` data-frame profile for light commercial vehicles
- `p_hgv` data-frame profile for heavy good vehicles or trucks
- `p_bus` data-frame profile for bus
- `p_mc` data-frame profile for motorcycles

## Vehicular composition


## Application

As mentioned above, the application consists in using the travel demand model
for west part of São Paulo city, present in vein. This script reads traffic data
and expand applying an age function. It will be used the `inventory` function
with the default vehicular composition, shown on section (\@red(st)). Please,
use the scripts in the extra material of this book. The base year is 2015 and the
extended example is available in appendix 1.


```{r eval = FALSE}
library(vein)
inventory(file.path(tempdir(), "YourCity"))
setwd("YourCity")
data(net) # Loads the traffic demand simulation for west São Paulo
data(net)
data(pc_profile)
pc_week <- temp_fact(net$ldv+net$hdv, pc_profile)
speed <- netspeed(pc_week, net$ps, net$ffs, net$capacity, net$lkm)
saveRDS(net, file = "network/net.rds")
saveRDS(speed, file = "network/speed.rds")
```

# Emission Factors {#ef}

An emission factor is the amount of mass of pollutant generated by activities
[@pulles2010art]. In the case of vehicles, the emission factors are generally
known as the mass of pollutant per traveled distance $g \cdot km^{-1}$ in metric
units. The distance unit could be different, like miles for instance. 
The type of units depends on measurement used when developing the emission factors.

There are hot and cold exhaust emisions. _Hot_ exhaust emissions are produced by a 
vehicle when its engine and exhaust after-treatment system are at their normal
operational temperatures and _Cold_ during the vehicle warm-up phase [@trlef].

The emission factors comes from measurement of pollutants emitted by the sources.
In the case of vehicles, the dynanometer measurements the emission factors are
the mass of pollutant collected during the distance traveled by a vehicle 
following a specific driving cycle. The Federal Test Procedure (FTP) is a test
to certify the vehicle emissions under the driving cycles such as FTP-75. This
driving cycle has a duration of 1874 $s$ for a distance of 17783 $m$ and average
speed of 34.12 $km \cdot h^{-1}$ [@tim].

In the literature it is possible to find different type of emission factors. For
instance, in europe, during the development of the project Assesment of 
Reliability of Transport Emission Models and Inventory Systems (ARTEMIS), it was
developed the *traffic situation model*. This concept consists in the 
combination of parameters that affects the vehicle kinematics and engine 
operation: type of road, sinuosity and gradient, trafffic conditions or level
of service (free-flow, heavy, saturated and stop and go) and average speed by
speed limit of the road [@artemis]. Measurenets of vehicular emissions under 
each traffic situation led to emission factors by traffic situation, used in the
Handbook of Emission Factors (HBEFA, www.hbefa.net).

There is another approach based on 1 Hz measurement of emissions. Here, the
pollutants are measured on real live traffic driving. Emission factors can be
derived here using mainly two approaches. One approach is applying the Vehicular
Specific Power (VSP) [@jimenez1999vehicle]. This methods is used in the MOtor 
Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES) [@koupal2003design] and the International
Vehicle Emissions model (IVE) [@Davisetal2005]. Another approach is to apply 
the Passenger car and Heavy-duty Emission Model (PHEM), which is based on
instantaneous engine power demand and engine speed developed during the Artemis 
project [@tim, @artemis].

Perhaps the most used approach to obtain emission factors are the speed 
functions. As the emissions tests on driving cycles are valid for only one
average speed, measuring emissions of different driving cycles at different
average speeds, allow to obtain point clouds where a regressions is applied,
obtaining an emission factor as a speed function. The literature shows
experiments in diffferent parts of the world, such as in Chile 
[@Corvalanetal2002] and Europe [@ntziachristos2000speed]. However, probably
the most used source of emission factors as speed functions are the European 
emission guidelines developed by the European Monitoring and Evaluation
Programme (EMEP, http://www.emep.int/) and published by the European
Environment Agency (EEA, https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/air/emep-eea-air-pollutant-emission-inventory-guidebook/emep) [@NtziachristosSamaras2016]. These emission factors are included
in the VEIN model.

Another aspect important in vehicular emissions is the degradation of the
emissions of aged vehicles. Over the time, different part of the vehicles suffer
deterioration, increasing the emissions. Therefore, approachas have been 
developed to account of this effect in inventories. One approach consists in
determining functions that increment the emissions by accumulated mileage, such
as studies of -@CorvalanVargas2003.

In Brazil, the emission factors are reported by the Environmental Protection 
Agency of São Paulo -@CETESB2015, in their vehicular emissions inventory report.
Light vehicles emission factors comes from average measurements of the FTP75 
driving cycle, motorcycle emission factors comes from average measurements of 
World Motorcycle Test Cycle (WMTC) and HDV with from the European Stationary 
Cycle (ETC).

As the VEIN model was developed in Brazil, but user of other parts of the world
may be intereted in using the model, the approach in VEIN has to allow
flexibility to the user. Therefore, the emission factors approach in VEIN 
consists in three options, as shown on Fig. (\@ref(fig:diaef)). The first approach
consists in local emissions factors by age of use, such as the one from 
-@CETESB2015, denoted as local_ef in the green circle. The second approach
consists in selecting speed functions from -@NtziachristosSamaras2016, availabe 
in VEIN and denoted as the grey box as speed_ef. The third approach conists in
incorporate speed variation from the speed function into the local emission
factors by age of use. In any case, VEIN count with function to account of the
degradation of emissions due to accumulated mileage denotes in grey box as
emis_det. These emissions are entered into the estimation emission function.

The following sections show how to do these calculation in VEIN, step by step.

## Speed functions `ef_ldv_speed` and `ef_hdv_speed` {#speedef} 

The estimation of emissions in VEIn is shown the equation \@ref(eq:emi):

\begin{equation}
EH_{i,j,k,l,m} =F_{i,j,k,l} \cdot L_i \cdot EF(V_{i,l})_{j,k,m} \cdot DF_{j,k}
(\#eq:emi)
\end{equation}

Where  $EH_{i,j,k,l,m}$ is the emissions for each street link $i$, vehicle category
from composition $k$, hour $l$ and pollutant $m$, where $F_{i,j,k,l}$ is the
vehicular flow calculated in Eq. 1. $L_i$ is the length of the street link $i$.
$EF(V_{i,l})_{j,k,m}$ is the emission factor of each pollutant $m$. $DF_{j,k}$ is
the deterioration factor for vehicle of type $j$ and age of use $k$, explained
in detial in section \@ref(det).


These function return speed functions as $f(V)$. The functions comes from the 
EMEP/EEA emissions guidelines [@NtziachristosSamaras2016] and are available
in PDF reports. The equations and their parameter were translated to 
spreedsheets and loaded internally in VEIN. Therefore, the user only must
enter the required parameters obtaining the desired function. The functions
respect the assumptions and speed limits.

### Emission factors of LDV depending on  speed with the function `ef_ldv_speed`

The arguments for `ef_ldv_speed` are:

- `v`: Category vehicle: "PC", "LCV", "Motorcycle" or "Moped".
- `t`: Sub-category of of vehicle: PC: "ECE_1501", "ECE_1502", "ECE_1503", 
"ECE_1504" , "IMPROVED_CONVENTIONAL", "OPEN_LOOP", "ALL", "2S" or "4S". LCV: "4S", 
Motorcycle: "2S" or "4S". Moped: "2S" or "4S".
- `cc`: Size of engine in cc: PC: "<=1400", ">1400", "1400_2000", ">2000", "<=800",
"<=2000". Motorcycle: ">=50" (for "2S"), "<=250", "250_750", ">=750". Moped: 
"<=50". LCV : "<3.5" for gross weight.
- `f`: Type of fuel: "G", "D", "LPG" or "FH" (Full Hybrid: starts by electric 
motor).
- `eu`: Euro standard: "PRE", "I", "II", "III", "III+DPF", "IV", "V", "VI" or 
"VIc".
- `p`: Pollutant: "CO", "FC", "NOx", "HC" or "PM".
- `k`: Multiplication factor.
- `show.equation`: Option to see or not the equation parameters.

It is very important that the user enter the right value into the arguments
because the final category must match. If the user enters values that do not
match, the resulting speed function will be wrong. There are 146 matchs. The
probably most used combinations are:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
df <- read.csv("figuras/matchs.csv")
df <- df[df$v %in% c("PC", "LCV", "Motorcycle") &
           df$t == "4S", ]
df <- data.frame(
  Argument  = c("v", "t", "cc", "f", "eu", "p"),
  Value = c("PC LCV Motorcycles",
            "4S",
            "<=1400 1400_2000 >2000",
            "G D",
            "PRE I II III IV V VI",
            "CO NOx HC FC PM"))
knitr::kable(df,
             caption = 'Most used combinations for emission factors for LDV',
             booktabs = TRUE
)
```

The returning speed function represents how a type of vehicle emits pollutants
on average. Fig. (\@ref(fig:figef)) shows the emissions of CO by Passenger 
Cars with with technologies Pre Euro and Euro I from -@NtziachristosSamaras2016.
Higher emissions occure at low average speeds and older vehicles with
technologies pre Euro emit more than vehicles with Euro I. Even more, the 
average emissions of Pre Euro are 29.31 $g \cdot km^{-1}$ and Euro I 2.61
$g \cdot km^{-1}$, meaning that, on average, a vehicle Pre euro is 14 times than
a vehicle with euro I. 

The Fig. (\@ref(fig:figef)) shows the plot using the package ggplot2 [@ggplot2]. This package requires that the data must be in long format. 

```{r figef, fig.cap='Emission factor as a speed function', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}

ef2 <- ef_ldv_speed(v = "PC", cc = "<=1400", f = "G",
                    eu = "I", p = "CO", show.equation = F)
V <- 0:110
df <- data.frame(EF = c(ef1(V), ef2(V)))
df$V = V
df$Euro <- factor(c(rep("PRE", 111), rep("I", 111)),
                  levels = c("PRE", "I"))
ggplot(df, aes(V, EF, colour = Euro)) + geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_line() + theme_bw()+
  labs(y = "CO[g/km]", x = "[km/h]")
```

### Emission factors of HDV depending on  speed with the function `ef_hdv_speed`


The arguments for `ef_hdv_speed` are:

```{r}
args(ef_hdv_speed)
```

- `v`	:Category vehicle: "Coach", "Trucks" or "Ubus"
- `t`	Sub-category of of vehicle: "3Axes", "Artic", "Midi", "RT, "Std" and "TT"
- `g`	Gross weight of each category: "<=18", ">18", "<=15", ">15 & <=18", "<=7.5", - ">7.5 & <=12", ">12 & <=14", ">14 & <=20", ">20 & <=26", ">26 & <=28", ">28 & <=32", ">32", ">20 & <=28", ">28 & <=34", ">34 & <=40", ">40 & <=50" or ">50 & <=60"
- `eu	Euro emission standard: "PRE", "I", "II", "III", "IV" and "V"
- `gr	Gradient or slope of road: -0.06, -0.04, -0.02, 0.00, 0.02. 0.04 or 0.06
- `l`	Load of the vehicle: 0.0, 0.5 or 1.0
- `p`	Pollutant: "CO", "FC", "NOx" or "HC"
- `k`	Multiplication factor
- `show.equation`	Option to see or not the equation parameters

```{r}
V <- 0:130
ef1 <- ef_hdv_speed(v = "Trucks",t = "RT", g = "<=7.5",
                    e = "II", gr = 0,
l = 0.5, p = "HC", show.equation = FALSE)
ef2 <- ef_hdv_speed(v = "Trucks",t = "RT", g = "<=7.5",
                    e = "II", gr = 0.06,
l = 0.5, p = "HC", show.equation = FALSE)
plot(1:130, ef1(1:130), pch = 16, type = "b",
     ylab = "HC [g/km]", xlab = "Speed [km/h]")
lines(1:130, ef2(1:130), pch = 16, type = "b", col = "blue")

```

## Local emission factors by age of use. The functions `EmissionFactors` and `EmissionFactorsList` {#localef}

The functions `EmissionFactors` and `EmissionFactorsList` creates the classes
with the same names. The class `EmissionFactors` is also a data-frame with
numeric columns with units of $g \cdot km^{-1}$. This class is not used in 
critical steps of VEIN, and it has a purpose of only creating data-frame with
numeric columns with units. The this function is applied to a numeric vector,
it just convert it to `units` adding units to it.

In the case of `EmissionFactorsList`, this class is a list of functions $f(V)$.
This is usefull because the `emis` function, seen in detail on chapter
\@ref(est), requires that the emission factors are functions of Velocity $f(V)$, 
regardless $f(V)$ is constant or not. When this function is applied to a 
data-frame or to a matrix, it returns a list and each columns of the data-frame 
or matrix is another list. Also, each row of the original data-frame is converted
to a $f(V)$. 

The arguements or `EmissionFactorsList` and `EmissionFactors` are:

-`x`: Object with class "data.frame", "matrix" or "numeric"

The following lines of ode show examples using `EmissionFactors`. Firstly, it
is loaded the dataset of emission factors _fe2015_ for CO and the vehicles
PC using gasoline PC_G and Light Trucks LT. The class of fe2015 is data-frame.
The subset of the data is named DF_CO. When we see the first 6 elemens of the
data-frame are numbers without units.

```{r}
library(vein)
data(fe2015) #CETESB Emission factors
DF_CO <- fe2015[fe2015$Pollutant=="CO", c("PC_G", "LT")]
head(DF_CO)
```

The object EF_CO has class`EmissionFactors` and "data-frame" and each 
observation has the units $g \cdot km^{-1}$.

```{r}
EF_CO <- EmissionFactors(DF_CO)
head(EF_CO)
class(EF_CO)
```

The plot of an object with class `EmissionFactors` shows maximum 9 emission
factors. Fig. (\@ref(fig:efco)) shows the emission factors of both categories,
where newer vehicles emit less and older vehicles emit more.

```{r efco, fig.cap='Emission factor of PC and LT by age of use', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
plot(EF_CO, xlab = "Age of use")
```

Regarding the class `EmissionFactorsList`, the `print` and `summary` methods
are very simply, ony showing a description of the object. The example of
the following lines of code also uses the same set of Emission Factors from
-@CETESB2015. The resulting object, EF_COL, has class `EmissionFactorsList` and
`list`. The print of the object shows only a description of the first and
last member of the list object.


```{r}
EFL_CO <- EmissionFactorsList(DF_CO)
class(EFL_CO)
EFL_CO
```

Indeed, we want to see the content of the `EmissionFactorsList` we would have to
extract the elements of the list. EFL_CO has two list, each one for PC and LT.
Then, each list has 36 functions, the command `class(EFL_CO[[1]][[1]])` shows
the object is a functon $f(V)$.

```{r}
EFL_CO[[1]][[1]]
```

Also, as the speed functions are constant, there is no need to add values of V. 

```{r}
EFL_CO[[1]][[1]](100) # constant speed function
EFL_CO[[1]][[1]](0)   # constant speed function
```

Finally, after extracting the value, Fig.
(\@ref(fig:efco2)) shows the same figure as Fig. (\@ref(fig:efco))

```{r efco2, fig.cap='Emission factor of PC and LT', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
efco1 <- sapply(1:36, function(i) EFL_CO[[1]][[i]]())
efco2 <- sapply(1:36, function(i) EFL_CO[[2]][[i]]())
df <- EmissionFactors(cbind(efco1, efco2))
plot(df, xlab = "Age of use")

```

## Incorporating speed variation with the functions `ef_ldv_scaled` and `ef_hdv_scaled`  {#scale}

The functions on section \@ref(speedef) and \@ref(localef) showed the speed
and local emission factors respectivly. However, the user might have local
and constant emission factors depending only on age of use, but also, outputs
from a traffic demand model which includes speed. Under those circumnstances, it
would be interesting to investigate the effects of the average speed of traffic
flow. VEIN includes a function to transform a constant emission factor by age of
use into a speed dependent function.

This functions are called `ef_ldv_scaled` and `ef_hdv_scaled`. The concept is
explained in detail in my Ph.D thesis [@ibarrathesis]. The idea is comes from 
revisitng the nature of the local emission factors. The Brazilian emission 
factors consist of average measurements emissions certification tests which use 
the  driving cycles Federal Test Procedure FTP-75 for LDV, World Motorcycle Test 
Cycle (WMTC) for motorcycles, and also the European Stationary Cycle (ESC) for 
HDV [@CETESB2015]. The average speed of FTP-75 and WMTC are known, being 34.2
$km \cdot h^{-1}$ and 54.7 $km \cdot h^{-1}$ based to the reference report on
driving cycles from the Transport and Research Laboratory (TRL) [@tim]. In the
case of ESC, the user might search on literature a way to relate this cycle
with an average speed.

Coming back to the -@CETESB2015 emission factors, these are annual average values
of emissions for the different technologies to accomplish Brazilian emission 
standards, which are valid only for a specific average speed.If two vehicles have
similar technology but different emission factors, one constant and other speed
function, it would be possble to relate them. These functions use the speed to 
relate both emission factors. The condition to transform a contant emission
factor into a speed dependent function is that, the new speed dependent function
must be the same value at the speed which is representative the local factor,
and the values at other speeds are the incorporation of the speed variation.
The equation \@ref(eq:efscaled) shows the procedure:

\begin{equation}
EF_{scaled}(V_{i,l})_{j,k,m}=EF(V_{i,l})_{j,k,m} \cdot \frac{EFlocal_{j,k,m}}{{EF(Vdc_{i,l})_{j,k,m}}}
(\#eq:efscaled)
\end{equation}

Where $EF_{scaled}(V_{i,l})_{j,k,m}$ is the scaled emission factor and 
$EF(V_{i,l})_{j,k,m}$ is the Copert emission factor for each street link $i$,
vehicle from composition $k$, hour $l$ and pollutant $m$. $EFlocal_{j,k,m}$
represents the constant emission factor (not as speed functions). 
$EF(Vdc_{i,l})_{j,k,m}$ are Copert emission factors with average speed value of
the respective driving cycle for the vehicular category $j$. 

The functions `ef_ldv_scaled` and `ef_hdv`_scaled` returns scaled emissions
factors automatically. The arguments are:

- `df`: Data-frame with emission factors (Deprecated in 0.3.10).
- `dfcol`: Numeric vector with the emission factors constant by age of use. These
emission factors are the target to incorporate peed variation.
- `SDC`: A number with the speed of the driving cycle of the emission factors
from the argumetn `dfcol`. The resulting speed functions will return the same
values of dfcol at the speed `SDC`. The default is 34.12 "km/h".
- `v`. Category vehicle: "PC", "LCV", "Motorcycle" or "Moped". 
- `t`. Character; sub-category of of vehicle: PC: "ECE_1501", "ECE_1502",
"ECE_1503", "ECE_1504" , "IMPROVED_CONVENTIONAL", "OPEN_LOOP", "ALL", "2S" or "4S".
LCV: "4S", Motorcycle: "2S" or "4S". Moped: "2S" or "4S". The default is `4S`.
- `cc`. Character; size of engine in cc: PC: "<=1400", ">1400", "1400_2000", 
">2000", "<=800", "<=2000". Motorcycle: ">=50" (for "2S"), "<=250", "250_750", 
">=750". Moped: "<=50". LCV : "<3.5" for gross weight.
- `f`: Character; type of fuel: "G", "D", "LPG" or "FH" (Full Hybrid: starts by 
electric motor).
- `eu`: Character; euro standard: "PRE", "I", "II", "III", "III+DPF", "IV", "V", "VI" or "VIc".
- `p`: Character; pollutant: "CO", "FC", "NOx", "HC" or "PM".

And the argument of `ef_hdv_scaled` are:

## Cold Starts

Cold start emissions are produced during engine startup, when the engine and/or
catalytic converter system has not reached its normal operational temperature. Sev-
eral studies have shown the significant impact for these types of emissions 
[@chenetal2011, @Weilenmannetal2009]. Under this condition emissions will be 
higher, and if the atmospheric temperature decreases, cold start emissions will 
increase regardless of whether the catalyst has reached its optimum temperature for
functioning [@artemis]. VEIN also considers cold start emissions using the approach
outlined in Copert [@NtziachristosSamaras2016], as shown in equation 
\@ref(eq:cold).

\begin{equation}
EC_{i,j,k,l,m} =\beta_{j} \cdot F_{i,j,k,l} \cdot L_i \cdot EF(V_{i,l})_{j,k,m} \cdot DF_{j.k} \cdot \left(EF_{\mbox{cold}}(ta_n,V_{i,l})_{j,k,m}-1\right)
(\#eq:cold)
\end{equation}

This approach adds two terms to Eq. \ref{eq:emi}. The first term
$EF_{cold}(ta_n,V_{i,l})_{j,k,m}-1$ is the emission factors for cold start 
conditions at each street link $i$, vehicle category from composition $k$, hour $l$
and pollutant $m$ and monthly average temperature $n$.
[@NtziachristosSamaras2016] suggest using monthly average temperature. This is an 
important aspect that will be reviewed in future versions of VEIN.

The second term $\beta_j$ is defined as the fraction of mileage driven with a cold 
engine/catalyst [@NtziachristosSamaras2016]. The VEIN model incorporates a dataset 
of cold starts recorded during the implementation of the International Vehicle 
Emissions (IVE) model [@Davisetal2005] in São Paulo [@ivesp], which 
provides the hourly mileage driven with cold start conditions.

The function for cold start emission factors is `ef_ldv_cold` and their arguments
are:

```{r}
args(ef_ldv_cold)
```

where:

- `v`:	 Category vehicle: "LDV".
- `ta`: Ambient temperature. Monthly men can be used.
- `cc`: Size of engine in cc: "<=1400", "1400_2000" or ">2000".
- `f`: Type of fuel: "G", "D" or "LPG".
- `eu`: Euro standard: "PRE", "I", "II", "III", "IV", "V", "VI" or "VIc".
- `p`: Pollutant: "CO", "FC", "NOx", "HC" or "PM".
- `k`: Multiplication factor.
- `show.equation`: Option to see or not the equation parameters.


```{r}
ef1 <- ef_ldv_cold(ta = -5, cc = "<=1400", f ="G", eu = "I", p = "CO")
ef2 <- ef_ldv_cold(ta = 0, cc = "<=1400", f ="G", eu = "I", p = "CO")
ef3 <- ef_ldv_cold(ta = 5, cc = "<=1400", f ="G", eu = "I", p = "CO")
ef4 <- ef_ldv_cold(ta = 10, cc = "<=1400", f ="G", eu = "I", p = "CO")
```

```{r efcold, fig.cap='Cold Emission factor of PC CO (g/km)', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
V <- 0:100
df <- data.frame(EF = c(ef1(V), ef2(V), ef3(V), ef4(V) ))
df$Speed <- V
df$Temperature <- factor(c(rep("-5", length(V)),
                    rep( "0", length(V)),
                    rep("5", length(V)),
                    rep("10", length(V))),
                    levels = c("10", "5", "0", "-5"))
ggplot(df, aes(x = Speed, y = EF, colour = Temperature)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) + geom_line() +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "Speed [g/km]", y = "CO [g/km]")
```

There is another function called `ef_ldv_cold_list` which will be deprecated soon.

## Deterioration {#det}

By default, VEIN includes deterioration factors from Copert 
[@NtziachristosSamaras2016]. However, it is possible to include other sources,
such as from [@CorvalanVargas2003] or included deteriorated local emission
factors. This aspesct is faced in vein with the function `emis_det`. This
function returns deteriorated factors, as numeric vectors, which must be multiplied
with the emission factors of vehicles with 0 mileage.

The arguments of this functions are:

```{r}
args(emis_det)
```

where:

- `p`: Pollutant.
- `cc`: Size of engine in cc.
- `eu`: Euro standard: "PRE", "I", "II", "III", "III", "IV", "V", "VI".
- `km`: mileage in km. VEIN includes a dataset of mileage function named "fkm".

```{r efDET, fig.cap='Deteriorated (red) and not-deteriorated (blue) EF CO', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}

data(fe2015)
data(fkm)
pckma <- cumsum(fkm$KM_PC_E25(1:24)) #only vehicles with catalizer
x1 <- fe2015[fe2015$Pollutant == "CO", ]
x1E3 <- subset(x1, x1$Euro_LDV %in% c("III", "IV", "V"))$PC_G
x1E1 <- subset(x1, x1$Euro_LDV %in% c("I", "II"))$PC_G
det_E3 <- emis_det(po = "CO", cc = 1000, eu = "III",
                   km = pckma[1:length(x1E3)])
det_E1 <- emis_det(po = "CO", cc = 1000, eu = "III",
                   km = pckma[(length(x1E3) + 1):23 ])
original_EF <- x1$PC
deteriorated_EF <- x1$PC * c(det_E3, det_E1, rep(1, 13))
plot(x = 1:36, y = original_EF, type = "b", pch = 15, col = "blue",
     ylab = "CO[g/km]", xlab = "Age of use")
#     main = "Deteriorated (red) and not-deteriorated (blue) EF CO")
lines(x = 1:36, y = deteriorated_EF,  type = "b", pch = 16, col = "red")

```

## Evaporative emissions `ef_evap`

Evaporative emissions are important sources of hydrocarbons and these emissions are
produced by vaporization of fuel due to variations in ambient temperatures
[@MelliosNtziachristos2016, @Andradeetal2017]. There are three types of emissions: 
**diurnal emissions**, due to increases in atmospheric temperature, which lead to 
thermal expansion of vapor fuel inside the tank; **running losses**, when the fuel
evaporates inside the tank due to normal operation of the vehicle; and **hot soak**
emissions, which occur when the hot engine is turned off. These methods implemented
in VEIN were sourced from the evaporative emissions methods of Copert Tier 2 
[@MelliosNtziachristos2016]. VEIN it is also possible to use local emission
factors. Here I'm showing both approaches:

a) Tier 2 copert approach

\begin{equation}
EV_{j,k} =\sum_{s}D_{s} \cdot \sum_{j}F_{j} \cdot (HS_{j,k}+de_{j,k}+RL_{j,k}) 
(\#eq:ev1)
\end{equation}

where $EV_{j}$ are the volatile organic compounds (VOC) evaporative emissions due 
to each type of vehicle $j$. $D_s$ is the "seasonal days" or number of days when 
the mean monthly temperature is within a determined range: 
[-5$^{\circ}$,10$^{\circ}$C],  [0$^{\circ}$,  15$^{\circ}$C], [10$^{\circ}$, 
25$^{\circ}$C] and [20$^{\circ}$, 35$^{\circ}$C]. $F_{j,k}$ is the number of 
vehicles according to the same type $j$ and age of use $k$. $HS_{j,k}$, $de_{j,k}$ 
and $RL_{j,k}$ are average hot/warm soak, diurnal and running losses evaporative 
emissions ($\mathrm{g \cdot day^{-1}}$), respectively, according to the vehicle 
type $j$ and age of use $k$. $HS_{j,k}$ and $RL_{j,k}$ are obtained using equations
also sourced from [@MelliosNtziachristos2016]:

\begin{equation}
HS_{j,k} = x_{j,k} \cdot (c \cdot (p \cdot e_{shc}+(1-p) \cdot e_{swc})+(1-c) \cdot e_{shfi} )
(\#eq:ev2)
\end{equation}

where $x$ are the number of trips per day for the vehicular type $j$ and age of use
$k$. $c$ is the fraction of vehicles with fuel return systems. $p$ is the fraction
of trips finished with hot engine, for example, an engine that has reached its
normal operating temperature and the catalyst has reached its light-off temperature
[@NtziachristosSamaras2016]. The light-off temperature is the temperature at the
point when catalytic reactions occur inside a catalytic converter. $e_{shc}$ and
$e_{swc}$ are average hot-soak and warm-soak emission factors for gasoline vehicles
with carburettor or fuel return systems ($\mathrm{g \cdot parking^{-1}}$).
$e_{shfi}$  is the average hot-soak emission factors for gasoline vehicles equipped
with fuel injection and non-return fuel systems ($\mathrm{g \cdot parking^{-1}}$).
The Eq. \@ref(eq:ev3) shows the procedure.

\begin{equation}
RL_{j,k} = x_{j,k} \cdot (c \cdot (p \cdot e_{rhc}+(1-p) \cdot e_{rwc})+(1-c) \cdot e_{rhfi} )
(\#eq:ev3)
\end{equation}


$x$ and $p$ have the same meanings of Eq. \@ref(eq:ev2). $e_{rhc}$ and  $e_{rwc}$
are average hot and warm running losses emission factors for gasoline vehicles with
carburettor or fuel return systems ($\mathrm{g \cdot trip^{-1}}$) and $e_{rhfi}$
are average hot running losses emission factors for gasoline vehicles equipped with
fuel injection and non-return fuel systems ($\mathrm{g \cdot trip^{-1}}$).
It is recommended to estimate the number of trips per day
[@MelliosNtziachristos2016], $x$, as the division between the mileage and 365 times
the length of trip: $x = \frac{mileage_j}{(365 \cdot ltrip)}$. However, the
mileage of a vehicle is not constant throughout the years. Therefore, VEIN
incorporates a dataset of equations to estimate mileage of different types of
vehicles by age of use [@BruniBales2013].

The function for evaporative emission factors is `ef_evap` and it arguments:

```{r}
args(ef_evap)
```

where:

- `ef`:	Name of evaporative emission factor as *eshotc* ($g \cdot proced^-1$): mean 
hot-soak with carburator, *eswarmc* ($g \cdot proced^-1$): mean cold and warm-soak 
with carburator, eshotfi: mean hot-soak with fuel injection, *erhotc*  ($g \cdot 
trip^-1$): mean hot running losses with  carburator, *erwarmc*  ($g \cdot trip^-1$) 
mean cold and warm running losses, *erhotfi*  ($g \cdot trip^-1$) mean hot running 
losses with fuel injection.

- `v`:	Type of vehicles, "PC", "Motorcycles", "Motorcycles_2S" and "Moped"
- `cc`: Size of engine in cc. PC "<=1400", "1400_2000" and "2000" Motorcycles_2S: "<=50". Motorcyces: ">50", "<250", "250_750" and ">750"
- `dt`: Average daily temperature variation: "-5_10", "0_15", "10_25" and "20_35"
- `ca`: Size of canister: "no" meaning no canister, "small", "medium" and "large"
- `k`: multiplication factor
- `show`: when TRUE shows row of table with respective emission factor.

Example:

```{r rlevap, echo = TRUE, fig.cap='Running losses evaporative emission actors (g/trip)', out.width='100%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center', warning=FALSE}
library(vein)
library(ggplot2)
library(cptcity)
dt <- c("-5_10", "0_15", "10_25", "20_35")
ef <- sapply(1:4, function(i){
  ef_evap(ef = "erhotc",v = "PC", cc = "<=1400",
                dt = dt[i], ca = "no",
                show = TRUE)
})
df <- data.frame(ef = ef, temp = c(0, 10, 20, 30))
source("theme_black.R")
ggplot(df, aes(x = temp, y = ef)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = cpt(n = 4), col = "white") + 
  labs(x = "Temperature[C]", y = "RL Evaporative NMHC [g/trip]") + 
  theme_black()
```


b) Alternative approach

The evaporative emission factors mentioned before are suitable for top-down
estimations. That approach also requires knowledge of the 'procedure' and
'trips'. In this section it is introduced an alternative which consists in
transform the emission factors into $g \cdot km^-1$ and then do a bottom-up
estimation.

In order to do that, we need to follows assumptions. First, we consider that
the number of procedures is equal to trips. Then estimates how many trips per 
day are produced each day and then estiamtes how many kilometers are driven
each day and convert th emission factors as shown on Eq. \@ref(eq:efev2).

\begin{equation}
EF_{ev}(\frac{g}{km})=EF(_{ev})(\frac{g}{trip}) \cdot A(\frac{trips}{day}) \cdot B(\frac{km}{day})^{-1}
(\#eq:efev2)
\end{equation}

Clearly, we need to know A $(\frac{trips}{day})$ and B$(\frac{km}{day})^{-1}$.
Diurnal evaporative emissions factors are expressed as  $(\frac{g}{day})$. To
conbvert to  $(\frac{g}{km})$ we only need the kilometers driven each day
$\frac{km}{day}^{-1}$.

Now, it will be shown an example with the evaporative emission factors from 
-@CETESB2015. These emission factors are based on the methodology Tier 2 from 
-@@MelliosNtziachristos2016. If we consider evaporative emission factors of 
Passenger Cars using Gasoline (blended with 25\% of Ethanol) [@CETESB2015] and
4.6 $(\frac{trips}{day})$ [@ibarrathesis].

```{r echo = FALSE}
evap <- readRDS("rds/evappc.rds")
head(evap)
```
The variable ed_20_35 are diurnal evaporative emission factors in $g \cdot day^{-1}$
and eshot_20_35 and erhot_20_35  $g \cdot trip^{-1}$.

```{r efEVAP, fig.cap='Hot Soak (blue), Diurnal (green) and Running Losses (red) EF (g/km)', out.width='100%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}

library(vein)
data(fkm)
evap$ed_20_35_gkm <- evap$ed_20_35 / fkm$KM_PC_E25(1:41)/365
evap$eshot_20_35_gkm <- evap$eshot_20_35 * 4.6/ fkm$KM_PC_E25(1:41)/365
evap$erhot_20_35_gkm <- evap$erhot_20_35  * 4.6/ fkm$KM_PC_E25(1:41)/365
plot(x = 1:41, y = evap$eshot_20_35_gkm, col = "blue", 
     type = "b", pch = 16,
     xlab = "Age of use", ylab = "EV NMHC [g/km]")
lines(x = 1:41, y = evap$ed_20_35_gkm, col = "red", 
      type = "b", pch = 15)
lines(x = 1:41, y = evap$erhot_20_35_gkm, col = "green", 
      type = "b", pch = 17)

```


## Emission factors of wear `ef_wear` 

Wear emissions are very important because they contribute with an important
fraction of PM from tyre and break wear. VEIN includes these functions from
-@NtziachristosBoulter2009 which incudewear emissions factors form tyre, break
and road abrassion.

The arguments are:

```{r}
args(ef_wear)
```

- `wear`: Character; type of wear: "tyre", "break" and "road"
type: Character; type of vehicle: "2W", "PC", "LCV", 'HDV"
- `pol`: Character; pollutant: "TSP", "PM10", "PM2.5", "PM1" and "PM0.1"
- `speed`: List of speeds
- `load`: Load of the HDV
- `axle`: Number of axle of the HDV

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(vein)
?ef_wear
```

## Emission factors from tunnel studies

With VEIN you can choose three type of emissions factors, speed functions,
local emission factors or scaled factors. In this section i will show how to
expand the use of local emission factors considering tunnel emission factors
[@perez2014emission], from the International Vehicle Emissions (IVE) Model 
[@Davisetal2005] applied in Colombia [@gonzalez2017relative].

-@perez2014emission measured air pollutant concentrations in two tunnels in São
Paulo city, one with predominant use of LDV vehicles and another with more HDV.
The resulting emission factors for the fleet are shown on Table \@ref(tab:eftun).

```{r eftun, echo=FALSE}
df <- EmissionFactors(data.frame(CO = c(5.8, 3.6),
                 NOx = c(0.3, 9.2)))
row.names(df) <- c("LDV", "HDV")
knitr::kable(df, 
  caption = 'Emission factors from tunnels in São Paulo 2014',
  booktabs = TRUE
)
```

If we want to compare with the -@CETESB2015 emission factors, we would have to
weight these factors with the fleet. The weight mean emission factor of CO and
Passenger Cars (PC) is 1.40 $g \cdot km^{-1}$ and for Light Trucks (LT) is
0.60 $g \cdot km^{-1}$. In the case of NOx, Passenger Cars (PC) is 0.16 $g \cdot 
km^{-1}$ and for Light Trucks (LT) is 3.24 $g \cdot km^{-1}$. The emission factors 
from the example are for vehicles with 0 kilometers without deterioration. Anyways, 
tunnel emission factors are higher that the weighted emission factors from CETESB.

```{r}
library(vein)
data(fe2015)
fecoPC <- fe2015[fe2015$Pollutant == "CO", "PC_G"]
fecoLT <- fe2015[fe2015$Pollutant == "CO", "LT"]
fenoxPC <- fe2015[fe2015$Pollutant == "NOx", "PC_G"]
fenoxLT <- fe2015[fe2015$Pollutant == "NOx", "LT"]
PC <- age_ldv(x = 1, name = "PC", agemax = 36, message = FALSE)
LT <- age_hdv(x = 1, name = "LT", agemax = 36, message = FALSE)
weighted.mean(fecoPC, PC)  # PC CO
weighted.mean(fecoLT, LT)  # LT CO
weighted.mean(fenoxPC, PC) # PC NOx 
weighted.mean(fenoxLT, LT) # LT NOx
```

If the user want to use tunnel emission factors from -@perez2014emission in VEIN, 
the user would have to use the same value for all respective categories of the
vehicular composition. For instance, after running `inventory`, include tunnel
emission factors in each `*input.R`.

## Emission factors from International Vehicle Emissions (IVE)

The IVE models applies the  vehicle specific power (VSP) methodology to predict
emissions [@jimenez1999vehicle]. The formlula is shown on Eq. \@ref(eq:vsp).

\begin{equation}
VSP = v \cdot (1.1 \cdot a + 9.81(atan(sin(grade))) + 0.132) + 0.000302v^3
(\#eq:vsp)
\end{equation}

where $v$ is velocity $(m \cdot s^{-1})$, $a$ is the second by second acceleration
$(m \cdot s^{-2})$ and grade the second by second change in height defined as
$\frac{(h_{t=0} - h_{t=-1})}{v}$; being $h$ as altitude $m$. This method requires
that the user measures the activity Global Position System (GPS) recordings 
second by second and/or emissions measurements with Portable Emissions Measurement
Systems (PEMS).

-@gonzalez2017relative measure the vehicular activity in the city of Manizales,
Colombia. In htis case, there were not PEMS measurements, but IVE allows to
produce emission factors from the GPS recordings based on Mobile EPA emissions
model[@arbor2003user, @Davisetal2005].

The resulting emission factors varies for each type of vehicle and includes several 
pollutants. If the user wants to use IVE emission factors in vein would have to 
add them in each `*input.R`, after running `inventory`.

# Estimation of emissions {#est}

The emissions estimation process was shown on Eq. \@ref(eq:emi) on chapter
\@ref(ef). In this equation, it was shown that how the emissions are obtained
by  multiplying the traffifc flow with the distance that each car travels
(length of the road if it is a road network), and emissions and deterioration
factors.

In this chapter I will show how VEIN interprets this and other
emission equations to estimate emissions. At the end of each section
The Fig. \@ref(fig:diaemis) showsa diagram with the estimation process. The pink boxes hows VEIN classes, the
circle data and the grey boxes functions. The object `Vehicles` is a class
consisting in a matrix of vehicles with untis $1 \cdot h^{-1}$, as shown on
chapter \@ref(traffic), however, _the units in `Vehicles` is not a requirement for estimating emissions_. The object of class `Speed` is a 
matrix of speeds with the number of columns as the calculated speeds at
different hours at each row. This object can be present or not, depending
on the type of emission factor considered, for instant, emission factors
not depending on speed. The object class of `EmissionFactorsList` are
list of functions depending on speed as $f(V)$. Each function can depend
on speed or not as shown on chapter \@ref(ef), section \@ref(localef). 
Lastly, the object lkm is the length of the road expressed in $lkm$.

The function `emis` reads the inputs and estimates the emissions producing
an object with class `EmissionsArray` which has 4 dimensions, number of

knitr::include_graphics("figuras/dia6.png")
```

The estimation process is done with the emissions functions. The emissions 
estimations functions are:

- `emis` for hot emissions,
- `emis_cold` for cold start emissions,
- `emis_evap` for evaporative emissions,
- `emis_paved` for resuspension emissions on paved roads, and
- `emis_wear` for  wear of breakes, tyres and roads.

These functions perform internal checks for ensuring that the length lkm has
the unit of $km$. This means that, if `lkm` has units different than $km$,
the function will not run. These function runs internally `lapply` which are
faster `for` written in C. Despite that these functions are fast, i will try
to make them faster with some RCPP implementation in future.

## The `emis` function

The arguments of `emis` are:

```{r}
args(vein::emis)
```

- `veh`: "Vehicles" data-frame or list of "Vehicles" data-frame. Each 
data-frame has number of columns matching the age distribution of that type 
of vehicle. The number of rows is equal to the number of streets link.
- `lkm`: Length of each link that must in $km$. As consequence, emission 
factors must be in $g \cdot km^{-1}$. 
- `ef`: "EmissionFactorsList". A list of emission factors as speed 
functions. Each element has the form $f(V)$. The implicit unit is
$g \cdot km^{-1}$.
- `speed`: "Speed" object. A Speed data-frame with number of columns as
hours. 
- `agemax`: Age of oldest vehicles of the vehicles veh. The information of 
this argument can be obtained from the `veh` argument Therefore, this 
argument will be deprecated.
- `profile`: Numerical or dataframe or matrix with nrows equal to the hours and cols 
to each day. This is traffic data normalized to the hour of the input traffic data.
- `hour`: Number of considered hours in estimation. As this information
can be derived form the argument `profile`, the default value is the number of
rows of the matrix profile.
- `day`: Number of considered days in estimation. As this information
can be derived form the argument `profile`, the default value is the number of
coluns of the matrix profile.
- `array`: When FALSE produces a dataframe of the estimation. When TRUE 
expects a profile as a dataframe producing an array with dimensions (streets
x columns x hours x days)

## The `emis_cold` function

The arguments of `emis_cold` are:

```{r}
args(vein::emis_cold)
```

The arguments are similar with `emis` with the difference that it is added
two arguments:

- `efcold`: List of functions of cold start emission factors of vehicular 
categories. Technically, each function is also of the form $f(V)$.
- `beta`: Datraframe with the hourly cold-start distribution to each day of the 
period. Number of rows are hours and columns are days. It represents the fraction 
of mileage driven under cold-start conditions.

The equation for estimating cold-start emissions is on Eq. \@ref(eq:cold).

## The `emis_evap` function

The estimation of evaporative emissions applies Tier 2 from 
-@MelliosNtziachristos2016. The approach followed in VEIN was very simply,
consisting in only adding elements of a data-frame.


```{r}
args(vein::emis_evap)
```

- `veh`: this are the number of vehicles at each age of use and for each street.
It is a `Vehicles` object.
- `name`: Character indicating the name of the vehicle.
- `size`: Character indicating the size of the vehicle.
- `fuel`: Character indicating the fuel of the vehicle.
- `age`: Numeric vector with the age distribution, for instance, 1:40 for vehicles between 1 and 40 years of use.
- `nd4`: Number of days of your perdiof of study with monthly average 
temperature between 20 and 35 celcius degrees. If the period of time is a year,
this is the annual number of days under that condition.
- `nd3`: Number of days of your perdiof of study with monthly average 
temperature between 10 and 25 celcius degrees.
- `nd2`: Number of days of your perdiof of study with monthly average 
temperature between 0 and 15 celcius degrees.
- `nd1`: Number of days of your perdiof of study with monthly average 
temperature between -5 and 10 celcius degrees.
- `hs_nd4`: Number of average daily hot-soak evaporative emissions for days with
temperature between 20 and 35 celcius degrees
- `hs_nd3`: Number of average daily hot-soak evaporative emissions for days with
temperature between 10 and 25 celcius degrees
- `hs_nd2`: Number of average daily hot-soak evaporative emissions for days with
temperature between 0 and 15 celcius degrees
- `hs_nd1`: Number of average daily hot-soak evaporative emissions for days with
temperature between -5 and 10 celcius degrees
- `rl_nd4`: Number of average daily running losses evaporative emissions for days
with temperature between 20 and 35 celcius degrees
- `rl_nd3`: Number of average daily running losses evaporative emissions for days 
with temperature between 10 and 25 celcius degrees
- `rl_nd2`: Number of average daily running losses evaporative emissions for days 
with temperature between 0 and 15 celcius degrees
- `rl_nd1`: Number of average daily running losses evaporative emissions for days 
with temperature between -5 and 10 celcius degrees
- `d_nd4`: Number of average daily diurnal evaporative emissions for days with
temperature between 20 and 35 celcius degrees
- `d_nd3`: Number of average daily diurnal evaporative emissions for days with
temperature between 10 and 25 celcius degrees
- `d_nd2`: Number of average daily diurnal evaporative emissions for days with
temperature between 0 and 15 celcius degrees
- `d_nd1`: Number of average daily diurnal evaporative emissions for days with
temperature between -5 and 10 celcius degrees


## The `emis_paved` function

Evaporative emissions are emissions of resuspended dust due to traffic circulating
ober paved or non-paved roads. These emissions can be an important source of mass 
particulate matter, and several cities programs that aims to improve air quality
by diminishing these emissions [@AMATO20103070]. However, these emissions are not
considered by in the European emissions guidelines, where their focus is on 
primary particles and not those resulting from the resuspension of previously 
deposited material [@NtziachristosBoulter2009].

The method adopted in VEIN comes from the USEPA [@paved] which presents equations
for annual, daily and hourly estimations:

\begin{equation}
EF_{paved}=k \cdot sL^{0.91} \cdot W^{1.02}
(\#eq:res1)
\end{equation}

Where

- $EF_{paved}$ is the emission factor of particulate matter.
- $k$ particle size splitter.
- $sL$ road surface silt loading $g \cdot m^{-2}$.
- $W$ average weight.

Equation \@ref(eq:res1) can be extrapolated to consider natural mitigation of 
rainy periods of time with daily basis:

\begin{equation}
EF_{anual} = EF_{paved} \cdot (1 - \frac{P}{4 \cdot N})
(\#eq:res2)
\end{equation}

Where

- $EF_{anual}$ anual or long term emission factor.
- $P$ number of days with accumulated rain above 0.254 mm.
- $N$ total number of days.

or hourly

\begin{equation}
EF_{hourly} = EF_{paved} \cdot (1 - \frac{1.2 \cdot P}{N})
(\#eq:res2)
\end{equation}

Where

- $EF_{annual}$ annual or long term emission factor.
- $P$ number of hours with accumulated rain above 0.254 mm.
- $N$ total number of hours. For instance, 8760 for 1 year.


The function `emis_paved` has the arguments:

```{r}
args(vein::emis_paved)
```

Where,

-`veh`: It is an array with dimenssions number of streets x hours of day x days of week.
- `lkm`: Length of each link.
- `k`: K_PM30 = 3.23, K_PM15 = 0.77, K_PM10 = 0.62 and K_PM2.5 = 0.15.
- `sL1`: Silt loading (g/m2) for roads with ADT <= 500.
- `sL2`: Silt loading (g/m2) for roads with ADT > 500 and <= 5000.
- `sL3`: Silt loading (g/m2) for roads with ADT > 5000 and <= 1000.
- `sL4`: Silt loading (g/m2) for roads with ADT > 10000.
- `W`: array of dimensions of veh. It consists in the hourly averaged weight of traffic fleet in each road.

For instance, Lets create an array of vehicles. The funcion `adt` calculates
the amount pf vehicles at all hours. Lets use the `data(net)` asumming no buses.
Let's calculate the total traffic for only 24 hours with the same profile. For
simplicity, let's assume that all vehicle are expressed in _vehicle equivalent_
and it is a dry period.

```{r}
library(vein)
data(net)
data(profiles)
vkpc  <- vkm(net$ldv*0.75, 1, matrix(profiles$PC_JUNE_2012[, 1]))
vklcv  <- vkm(net$ldv*0.1, 1, matrix(profiles$LCV_JUNE_2012[, 1]))
vkmc  <- vkm(net$ldv*0.15, 1, matrix(profiles$MC_JUNE_2012[, 1]))
vkhgv  <- vkm(net$hdv, 1, matrix(profiles$HGV_JUNE_2012[, 1]))
vk <- vkpc + vklcv + vkmc + vkhgv
dim(vk)
```

`W` is the average hourly fleet weight. It ahs the same dimensions of `adt2`. Let's
assume an individual weight of PC is 1, LCV 1.5, HGV = 10 and MC 0.5. This example
is a simplification, `adt` should be calculated with full characterization
of the fleet.

```{r}
wpc  <- vkm(net$ldv*0.75, 1, profiles$PC_JUNE_2012[, 1])*1
wlcv  <- vkm(net$ldv*0.1, 1, profiles$LCV_JUNE_2012[, 1])*1.5
wmc  <- vkm(net$ldv*0.15, 1, profiles$MC_JUNE_2012[, 1])*0.5
whgv  <- vkm(net$hdv, 1, profiles$HGV_JUNE_2012[, 1])*10
W <- (wpc + wlcv + wmc + whgv)/vk
W[is.na(W)] <- 0
dim(W)
```

and now we estimate the emissions with the default values form PM10.

```{r}
emi <- emis_paved(veh = vk, lkm = net$lkm, W = W)
emi[1:4, 1:4]
```

## The `emis_wear` function {#ew}

Wear emissions can be very important, in fact, these are second most important
source of particulate matter in Europe [@eear]. These methods in VEIN comes from
-@NtziachristosBoulter2009 which include wear of "tyre", "break" and "road".

The arguments of the function `emis_wear` are:

```{r}
args(vein::emis_wear)
```

Where,

- `veh`: Object of class "Vehicles".
- `lkm`: Length of the road.
- `ef`: list of emission factor functions class "EmissionFactorsList", length equals to hours.
- `agemax`: Age of oldest vehicles for that category
- `profile`: Dataframe or matrix with nrows equal to hours and ncol as days of 
the week
- `hour`: Number of considered hours in estimation, with default value as number
of rows of profile.
- `day`: Number of considered days in estimation, with default value as number
of columns of profile.

Let's estimate wear emissions! 

First, we get the emission factor with the `ef_wear` function:

```{r}
library(vein)
data(net)
data(profiles)
pro <- profiles$PC_JUNE_2012[, 1] # 24 hours
pc_week <- temp_fact(net$ldv+net$hdv, pro)
df <- netspeed(pc_week, net$ps, net$ffs, net$capacity, net$lkm, alpha = 1)
ef <- ef_wear(wear = "tyre", type = "PC", pol = "PM10", 
                            speed = df)
```

Then we estimate emissions

```{r}
emi <- emis_wear(veh = age_ldv(net$ldv, name = "VEH"), speed = df,
                 lkm = net$lkm, ef = ef, profile =  pro)
df <- emis_post(emi, pollutant = "PM", by = "streets_wide")
df[1:4, 1:4]
```



<!--chapter:end:06-est.Rmd-->

# Post estimation with `emis_post` {#post}


Once the emissions are estimated we obtained `EmissionsArray` objects, which as
mentioned before, they are arrays with the dimensions streets x age distribution of 
vehicles x hours x days.




```{r , eval = FALSE, include=FALSE, fig.cap='Post-emissions', out.width='100%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
library(DiagrammeR)

p1 <- grViz("digraph boxes_and_circles {
      graph [overlap = false,
            fontsize = 10,
            rankdir = TB,
            fontname = Helvetica]


      node [shape = box,
            style = filled,
            fillcolor = pink,
            fixedsize = false,
            color = black,
            fontcolor = black,
            fontize = 12]

      EmissionsArray;
      GriddedEmissionsArray;



      node [shape = box,

            fixedsize = false,
            fillcolor = grey88,
            color = black,
            fontcolor = black,
            fontize = 12]

      emis;
      emis_post;
      speciate;
      make_grid;
      emis_grid;
      emis_merge;

      edge [color = black,
            arrowhead = vee,
            penwidth = 1.5]

      emis -> EmissionsArray
      EmissionsArray -> emis_post
      emis_post->{speciate emis_merge emis_grid}
      speciate -> emis_merge
      {make_grid speciate emis_merge}->emis_grid
      emis_grid -> {EmissionsGrid GriddedEmissionsArray}
      }
      ")
```

```{r demispost, echo = FALSE, fig.cap='Post-emissions', out.width='100%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figuras/dia7.png")
```

Now the function `emis_post` reads the `EmissionsArray`
and and convert it to data-frames that are easier to manage. 

The arguments of `emis_post` are:

```{r}
args(vein::emis_post)
```

Where,

- `arra`: `EmissionsArray` obtained with the `emis` functions. It is an array of
emissions 4d: streets x category of vehicles x hours x days or 3d: streets x 
category of vehicles x hours
- `veh`: Character indicating the type of vehicle , for instance: "PC".
- `size`: Character indicating the size or weight, for instance: "<1400", 
"1400<cc<2000",
"GLP", "Diesel".
- `fuel`: Character indicating fuel, for instance: "Gasoline", "E_25",
"GLP", "Diesel".
- `pollutant`:  Character indicating the pollutant, for instance "CO", "NOx", etc.
- `by`: Character indicating type of output, "veh" for total vehicular category , 
"streets_narrow" or "streets_wide". This is the most important argument of this 
function. "streets_wide" returns a dataframe with rows as number of streets and 
columns the hours as days*hours considered, e.g. 168 columns as the hours of a whole 
week and "streets_wide repeats the row number of streets by hour and day of the week

Lets create some objects

## Emissions by street

From previous chapters we worked with `Vehicles`, `EmissionFactors` and estimate
emissions generating `EmissionsArray`. Now let's create an  `EmissionsArray`
object.

```{r}
library(vein)
library(veinreport)
library(cptcity)
library(ggplot2)
data(net)
data(profiles)
data(fe2015)
PC_G <- age_ldv(x = net$ldv, name = "PC")
# Estimation for 168 hour and local factors
pcw <- temp_fact(net$ldv, profiles$PC_JUNE_2014)
# June is not holliday in southern hemisphere
hdvw <- temp_fact(net$hdv, profiles$HGV_JUNE_2014)
speed <- netspeed(pcw + hdvw, net$ps, net$ffs, net$capacity, net$lkm, alpha = 1)
lef <- EmissionFactorsList(fe2015[fe2015$Pollutant=="CO", "PC_G"])
E_CO <- emis(veh = PC_G,lkm = net$lkm, ef = lef, speed = speed,
             profile = profiles$PC_JUNE_2014)
```

Now that we have our `EmissionsArray` E_CO, we can process it with the function
`emis_post`. The emissions by street are obtained with the argument `by` =
"streets_wide":

```{r}
E_CO_STREETS <- emis_post(E_CO, by = "streets_wide")
E_CO_STREETS[1:6, 1:3]
```

In the version 0.3.17 it was added the capability of returning an spatial object
class 'sf' with 'LINESTRING':

```{r pcco, fig.cap = "CO emisions of PC (g/h)"}
E_CO_STREETS <- emis_post(E_CO, by = "streets_wide", net = net)
class(E_CO_STREETS)
ggplot(E_CO_STREETS) + geom_sf(aes(colour = as.numeric(V9))) +
  scale_color_gradientn(colours = rev(cpt())) + theme_bw()+
  ggtitle("CO emissions at 08:00 (g/h)")
```

Now, if we estimate the NOx emissions of Light Trucks we will a slight different
pattern of emissions:

```{r ltnox, fig.cap = "NOx emisions of LT (g/h)"}
LT <- age_hdv(x = net$hdv, name = "LT")
lef <- EmissionFactorsList(fe2015[fe2015$Pollutant=="NOx", "LT"])
E_NOx <- emis(veh = LT, lkm = net$lkm, ef = lef, speed = speed,
              profile = profiles$PC_JUNE_2014)
E_NOx_STREETS <- emis_post(E_NOx, by = "streets_wide", net = net)
ggplot(E_NOx_STREETS) + geom_sf(aes(colour = as.numeric(V9))) +
  scale_color_gradientn(colours = rev(cpt())) + theme_bw()+
  ggtitle("NOX emissions at 08:00 (g/h)")
```


## Total emissions in data-frames

In order to obtain the total emissions in data-frame, the same function
`emis_post` is used, but in this case, with the argument `by` = "veh". We also
need to add arguments of `veh` for the type of vehicle, `size` the size or
gross weight, `fuel` and `pollutant`. The argument `net` is not required in
this case.

```{r}
E_NOx_DF <- emis_post(arra = E_NOx, veh = "LT", size = "Small", fuel = "B5",
                      by = "veh", pollutant = "NOx")
head(E_NOx_DF)
```

The resulting object is a data-frame with the name of the input array, then it has
the g/h. Also, the name of the vehicle, the size, fuel, pollutant, age and hour.
This is interesting because we can now what are the most pollutatn vehicle and
at which hour this emissions ocurres.

```{r}
E_NOx_DF[E_NOx_DF$g == max(E_NOx_DF$g), ]
```

The highest emissions by hour are of Light Trucks of 17 years of use at hour 11
on local time. However, it is possible to get more interesting insights of the
data. The datra can be aggregated by age, hour or plot all together as shown on
Fig. \@ref(fig:noxlt3). The highest emissions ocurre between 17 and 27 years of use.
This figure also shows the effect of emissions standards introduced in 
different years.

```{r noxlt1, fig.cap = "NOx emissions of LT by hour"}
df <- aggregate(E_NOx_DF$g, by = list(E_NOx_DF$hour), sum)
plot(df, type = "b", pch = 16, xlab = "hour", ylab = "NOx (g/h)")
```

```{r noxlt2, fig.cap = "NOx emissions of LT by age"}
library(ggplot2)
library(veinreport) # theme_black
df <- aggregate(E_NOx_DF$g, by = list(E_NOx_DF$age), sum)
names(df) <- c("Age", "g")
ggplot(df, aes(x = Age, y = as.numeric(g), fill = as.numeric(g))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  scale_fill_gradientn(colours = cpt()) + theme_black() +
  labs(x = "Age of use", y = "NOx (g/h)")
```


```{r noxlt3, fig.cap = "NOx emissions of LT"}
library(ggplot2)
library(veinreport) # theme_black
ggplot(E_NOx_DF, aes(x = age, y = as.numeric(g), fill = hour)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  scale_fill_gradientn(colours = cpt()) + theme_black() +
  labs(x = "Age of use", y = "NOx (g/h)")
```


## Merging emissions

The function `inventory` was designed to store the emissions of each type of vehicle in 
each directory. Hence, it was necessary to create a function that read and merge the 
emissions that are in each directory, returning a data-frame os a spatial feature 
data-frame. The function is `emis_merge`. As it can be seen on
Fig. \@ref(fig:demispost), `emis_merge` comes after `emis_post` or `speciate`. The arguments
of `emis_merge` are:

```{r}
args(vein::emis_merge)
```

Where,

- `pol`: Character. Pollutant.
- `what`: Character. Word to search the emissions names, "STREETS", "DF" or whatever name. It is important to include the extension .'rds'
- `streets`: Logical. If true, emis_merge will read the street emissions created with 
emis_post by "streets_wide", returning an object with class 'sf'. If false, it will read the
emissions data-frame and rbind them.
- `net`: 'Spatial feature' or 'SpatialLinesDataFrame' with the streets. It is expected #' 
that the number of rows is equal to the number of rows of street emissions. If #' not, the 
function will stop.
- `path`: Character. Path where emissions are located
- `crs`: coordinate reference system in numeric format from http://spatialreference.org/ to 
transform/project spatial data using sf::st_transform

In order to see how this functions works, let's run the example in the `inventory` function.
First, lets create a project, or in other words a directory named "YourCity", into the 
temporary directory. In this part you can place your project wherever you want with the
actual name of your city. Then run `inventory` with the default configuration.

```{r}
name = file.path(tempdir(), "YourCity")
vein::inventory(name = name)
```

In my case, the files are in directory `r name`. Now, if you open the file file 
main.R, you will see:

```{r fmain, echo = FALSE, out.width='70%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figuras/main.png")
```

This script starts with  `setwd` function, Then the first section is the network, where
user reads and prepares the traffic information. Then the second section runs a script
whichruns the age functions for the deault vehicular composition of the `inventory` function. The third section  estimates the emissions by running each input.R file inside the
directory _est_ The fourth section, creates a grid and run the script post.R is shown below:


```{r fpost, echo = FALSE, out.width='70%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figuras/post.png")
```

The function `emis_merge` shown in line 2 is designed to read the all the files with names 
CO and the default argument `what` is "STREETS.rds", for instance, 
PC_GASOLINE_CO_STREETS.rds. Hence, this function reads all
the files under that condition. The other argument is `streets` with defailt value of 
`TRUE`, meaning that the function now knows that the resulting object must be an spatial
network, and the `net` argument is already calling the net object part of the VEIN data, 
the function will merge all the objects summing the emissions of all vehicle street by 
street. The resulting object is a spatial "LINESTRING" class of `sf`. This function assumes 
that emissons files are data.frames and non tests have been made to see if this function would read work `sf` objects.

On the other hand, the line 12 also runs all the emissions files whose names includes the word CO, but also including the words "DF.rds", which are the files from `emis_post` with
argument `by` equals to "veh". In this case, it reads and merge the data-frames and prints
the sum emissions by pollutant.

If the user source he file main.R, it will calculate the emissions and produce some plots.

```{r eval = FALSE}
source(paste0(name, "/main.R"))
```


## Creating grids

Once we have processed our emissions array with `emis_post` and/or we have
spatial emissions, we can then create grids and allocate our emissions
into the grids. Lets check the function `make_grid` first:

```{r}
args(vein::make_grid)
```

This function originally used an `sp` approach. However, now uses an `sf`
approach for creating the grid. Actually, the arguments are pretty much the
same with the `sf::st_make_grid` with the exeption that is focused in returning
polygons with coordinates at centroids of each cell. Therefore, the arguments
height and polygon are deprecated. Lets create grid for our net. 

```{r grid1, fig.cap="Grid with spacing of 500 mts"}
library(vein)
library(sf)
data(net)
net <- st_transform(st_as_sf(net), 31983)
g <- make_grid(spobj = net, width = 500)
class(g)
plot(g$geometry, axes = TRUE)
plot(net$geometry, add = TRUE)
```

The class of `net` is `SpatialLinesDataFrame`, which is converted to `sf`. 
Then, as the coordinte reference system of net is WGS84 with epsg 4326, we
are transforming to UTM to create a grid with grid spacing of 500 mts. The class
of the grid object, `g` is "sf data.frame". 

## Gridding emissions with `emis_grid`

The function`emis_grid` allocates emissions proportionally to each grid cell. 
The process is performed by intersection between geometries and the grid. It 
means that requires "sr" according with your location for the projection. It is 
assumed that spobj is a spatial*DataFrame or an "sf" with the pollutants in data.
This function return an object class "sf".

Before `sf` era, i tried to use`raster::intersect` which imports `rgeos` and
took **ages**. Then I started to use -@QGIS (https://www.qgis.org), and later 
the R package -@RQGIS which takes 10 minutes for allocating emissions of the
mega-city of São Paulo and a grid spacing of 1 km. *10 min is not bad*. However,
when `sf` appeared and also, included the Spatial Indexes (https://www.r-spatial.org/r/2017/06/22/spatial-index.html), it changed the game.
A new era started. It took **5.5 seconds**. I could not believe it. But there
also some i could accelerate this process importing some `data.table` aggregation
functions. Now `emis_grid` can aggegate big spatial extensions. I havent
tried yet at continental scale, but I will try. Anyways, let's go see the
arguments:

```{r}
args(vein::emis_grid)
```

Where,

- `spobj` : A spatial dataframe of class "sp" or "sf". When class is "sp" it is transformed to "sf".
- `g`: A grid with class "SpatialPolygonsDataFrame" or "sf".
- `sr`: Spatial reference e.g: 31983. It is required if spobj and g are not projected. Please, see http://spatialreference.org/.
- `type`: type of geometry: "lines" or "points".

```{r netgldv, fig.cap="Spatial grid of HDV traffic 500 mts"}
data(net)
net@data <- data.frame(hdv = net[["hdv"]])
g <- make_grid(spobj = net, width = 1/102.47/2)
netg <- emis_grid(net, g)
head(netg)
plot(netg["hdv"], axes = TRUE)
```

The example in this case, showed the allocation of traffic. The resulting object
is a `sf` with the sum of the attributes inside each grid cell. This means that,
when the input are street emissions at different hours, it will return gridded
emissions at each hour:

```{r Noxg, fig.cap="NOx emissions for 00:00 [g/h]"}
E_NOx_STREETS <- emis_post(E_NOx, by = "streets_wide", net = net)
NOxg <- emis_grid(E_NOx_STREETS, g)
plot(NOxg["V1"], axes = TRUE)

```

# Speciation {#he}

The speciation for emissions is a very important part that deserves a only 
chapter on this book. VEIN initially covered speed functions emission factors of
CO, HC, NOx, PM and Fuel Consumption (FC). But currently, the the pollutants
covered are:

- **Criteria**: "CO", "NOx", "HC", "PM", "CH4", "NMHC", "CO2", "SO2",
"Pb", "FC" (Fuel Consumption).
- **Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) and Persisten Organic Pollutants (POP)**: "indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene", "benzo(k)fluoranthene",
"benzo(b)fluoranthene", "benzo(ghi)perylene", "fluoranthene",
"benzo(a)pyrene", "pyrene", "perylene",  "anthanthrene", "benzo(b)fluorene",

Also, some Brazilian emission factors and speciations for WRF-Chem, mechanisms:

"E_SO4i", "E_SO4j", "E_NO3i", "E_NO3j", "E_MP2.5i", "E_MP2.5j", "E_ORGi", 
"E_ORGj", "E_ECi", "E_ECj", "H2O".

By the end of this book, more emission factors will be added.

Because VEIN has the capabilities to produce species from this pollutants 
including volatile organic compunds (VOC) and particulate matter compounds.

The speciation of emissions in VEIN can be done with three ways, by selecting
the pollutants in ef_speed* functions, other way explicit and the other implicit.
The explicit way is by usint the function `speciate` for the  specific available 
speciation. The implicit way is by adding a percentage value in the argument `k` 
in any of the functions of emission factors. The implicit  way requires that the 
user must know the percentage of the species of pollutant.

## Speed functions of VOC species

As mentioned before, the speed function emission factors, currently covers 
several pollutants. We firstly focus on som PAH and POP. They way to select them
is just:

```{r}
library(vein)
pol <- c("indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene", "benzo(k)fluoranthene",
         "benzo(b)fluoranthene", "benzo(ghi)perylene", "fluoranthene",
         "benzo(a)pyrene")
df <- lapply(1:length(pol), function(i){
  EmissionFactors(ef_ldv_speed("PC", "4S", "<=1400", "G", "PRE",
                               pol[i], x = 10)(10))
})
names(df) <- pol
df
```

These pollutants comes from -@NtziachristosSamaras2016 and in this case, are 
not dependent on speed. I used lapply to iterate in each pollutant at 10 km/h.
Now I will show the same for dioxins and furans.


```{r}
library(vein)
pol <- c("PCDD", "PCDF", "PCB")
df <- lapply(1:length(pol), function(i){
  EmissionFactors(ef_ldv_speed("PC", "4S", "<=1400", "G", "PRE",
                               pol[i], x = 10)(10))
})
names(df) <- pol
df
```




In the case of nmhc, the estimation is:


```{r}
library(vein)
pol <- c("ethane", "propane", "butane", "isobutane", "pentane")
df <- lapply(1:length(pol), function(i){
  EmissionFactors(ef_ldv_speed("PC", "4S", "<=1400", "G", "PRE",
                               pol[i], x = 10)(c(10,20,30)))
})
names(df) <- pol
df
```

Now the same example for one pollutant and several euro standards.


```{r}
library(vein)
euro <- c("V", "IV", "III", "II","I", "PRE")
df <- lapply(1:length(euro), function(i){
  EmissionFactors(ef_ldv_speed("PC", "4S", "<=1400", "G", euro[i],
                               "benzene")(c(10, 30, 50)))
})
names(df) <- euro
df
```


## Speciate function
The arguments of the function `speciate` are:

```{r}
args(vein::speciate)
```

Where,

- `x`: Emissions estimation
- `spec`: speciation: The speciations are: "bcom", tyre", "break", "road", "iag", "nox" and "nmhc". 'iag' now includes a speciation for use of industrial and building paintings. "bcom" stands for black carbon and organic matter.
- `veh`: Type of vehicle: When spec is "bcom" or "nox" veh can be "PC", "LCV", HDV" or "Motorcycle". When spec is "iag" veh can take two values depending: when the speciation is for vehicles veh accepts "veh", eu "Evaporative", "Liquid" or "Exhaust" and fuel "G", "E" or "D", when the speciation is for painting, veh is "paint" fuel or eu can be "industrial" or "building" when spec is "nmhc", veh can be "LDV" with fuel "G" or "D" and eu "PRE", "I", "II", "III", "IV", "V", or "VI". when spec is "nmhc", veh can be "HDV" with fuel "D" and eu "PRE", "I", "II", "III", "IV", "V", or "VI". when spec is "nmhc" and fuel is "LPG", veh and eu must be "ALL"
- `fuel`: Fuel. When spec is "bcom" fuel can be "G" or "D". When spec is "iag" fuel can be "G", "E" or "D". When spec is "nox" fuel can be "G", "D", "LPG", "E85" or "CNG". Not required for "tyre", "break" or "road". When spec is "nmhc" fuel can be G, D or LPG.
- `eu`: sEuro emission standard: "PRE", "ECE_1501", "ECE_1502", "ECE_1503", "I", "II", "III", "IV", "V", "III-CDFP","IV-CDFP","V-CDFP", "III-ADFP", "IV-ADFP","V-ADFP" and "OPEN_LOOP". When spec is "iag" accept the values "Exhaust" "Evaporative" and "Liquid". When spec is "nox" eu can be "PRE", "I", "II", "III", "IV", "V", "VI", "VIc", "III-DPF" or "III+CRT". Not required for "tyre", "break" or "road"
- `show`: when TRUE shows row of table with respective speciation
- `list`: when TRUE returns a list with number of elements of the list as the number species of pollutants

As shown before, there are currently 8 type of speciations. Now, i will show examples for most of them. 

## Black carbon and organic matter

Let's use the data inside the vein and estimate emissions. The 
vehicles considered are Light Trucks, assuming all HGV. We are using
the 4 stage estimation with the first part arranging traffic data

```{r}
library(vein)
# 1 Traffic data
data(net)
data(profiles)
data(fe2015)
lt <- age_hdv(net$ldv)
vw <- temp_fact(net$ldv, profiles$PC_JUNE_2014) + 
  temp_fact(net$hdv, profiles$HGV_JUNE_2014)
speed <- netspeed(vw, net$ps, net$ffs, net$capacity, net$lkm, alpha = 1)
# 2 Emission factors
euro <- c("V", rep("IV", 3),  
          rep("III", 7), rep("II", 7), rep("I", 5), rep("PRE", 27))
lefd <- lapply(1:50, function(i) {
  ef_hdv_speed(v = "Trucks", t = "RT", g = ">32", gr = 0,
               eu = euro[i], l = 0.5, p = "PM",
               show.equation = FALSE) })
# 3 Estimate emissions
pmd <- emis(veh = lt, lkm = net$lkm, ef = lefd, speed = speed,
            profile = profiles$HGV_JUNE_2014)
# 4 process emissions
# Agreggating emissions by age of use
df <- apply(X = pmd, MARGIN = c(1,2), FUN = sum, na.rm = TRUE)
euro
dfbcom <-   rbind(speciate(df[, 1], "bcom", "PC", "D", "V"),
                  speciate(rowSums(df[, 2:4]), "bcom", "PC", "D", "IV"),
                  speciate(rowSums(df[, 5:11]), "bcom", "PC", "D", "III"),
                  speciate(rowSums(df[, 12:18]), "bcom", "PC", "D", "II"),
                  speciate(rowSums(df[, 19:23]), "bcom", "PC", "D", "I"),
                  speciate(rowSums(df[, 24:50]), "bcom", "PC", "D", "PRE"))
dfbcom$id <- 1:1505 
bc <- aggregate(dfbcom$BC, by = list(dfbcom$id), sum)
om <- aggregate(dfbcom$OM, by = list(dfbcom$id), sum)
net$BC <- bc[, 2]
net$OM <- om[, 2]
```


Now we have spatial objects of Back Carbon

```{r spplotbm, fig.cap="Black Carbon [g/168h]"}
sp::spplot(net, "BC", scales = list(draw = T), main = "Black Carbon [g/168h]",
           col.regions = rev(cptcity::cpt()))
```

and Organic Matter

```{r spplotom, fig.cap = "Organic Matter [g/168h]"}
sp::spplot(net, "OM", scales = list(draw = T), main = "Organic Matter [g/168h]",
           col.regions = rev(cptcity::cpt()))
```

If you are interested in speciate total emissions by age of use not spatial
emissions, you could use `emis_post` with `by = "veh"` and then aggregate
the emissions by standard. Then speciate PM by standard:

```{r}
dfpm <- emis_post(arra = pmd,  veh = "LT", size = "small", fuel = "D",
                  pollutant = "PM", by = "veh")
dfpm$euro <- euro
dfpmeuro <- aggregate(dfpm$g, by = list(dfpm$euro), sum)
names(dfpmeuro) <- c("euro", "g")
bcom <- as.data.frame(sapply(1:6, function(i){
  speciate(dfpmeuro$g[i], "bcom", "PC", "D", dfpmeuro$euro[i])
}))
names(bcom) <- dfpmeuro$euro
```
And the resulting speciation is:

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(bcom, caption = "Black Carbon and Organic Matter [g/168h]", digits = 2)
```


## Tyre wear, breaks wear and road abrassion

Tyre, break and road abrassions comes from -@NtziachristosBoulter2009. Tyres 
consist in a complex mixture of rubber, which after the use starts to degradate.
In deed, when the driving cycle ismore aggresive, higher is tyre mass emitted
from tyre, with tyre wear emission factors higher in HDV than LDV. Break wear emits
mass and with more aggresive driving, more emissions. 

The input are wear emissions in Total Suspended Particles (TSP) ,as explained in
section \@ref(#ew). The speciation consists in 60% PM10, 42% PM2.5, 6% PM1 and
4.8% PM0.1. Now, a simple example for TP adspeciation:


```{r}
library(vein)
data(net)
data(profiles)
pro <- profiles$PC_JUNE_2012[, 1] # 24 hours
pc_week <- temp_fact(net$ldv+net$hdv, pro)
df <- netspeed(pc_week, net$ps, net$ffs, net$capacity, net$lkm, alpha = 1)
ef <- ef_wear(wear = "tyre", type = "PC", speed = df)
emit <- emis_wear(veh = age_ldv(net$ldv, name = "VEH"), speed = df,
                  lkm = net$lkm, ef = ef, profile =  pro)
emib <- emis_wear(what = "break", veh = age_ldv(net$ldv, name = "VEH"),
                  lkm = net$lkm, ef = ef, profile =  pro, speed = df)
emit
emib
emitp <- emis_post(arra = emit, veh = "PC", size = "ALL", fuel = "G",
                   pollutant = "TSP", by = "veh")
emibp <- emis_post(arra = emib, veh = "PC", size = "ALL", fuel = "G",
                   pollutant = "TSP", by = "veh")
```

The estimation covered 24 hours and for simplicity, we are assuming
a year with 365 similar days and dividing by 1 million to have t/y. Hence,the
speciation is:

```{r styre, fig.cap="Break and Tyre emissions (t/y)"}
library(ggplot2)
tyrew <- speciate(x =  unclass(emitp$g), spec = "tyre")
breakw <- speciate(x =  unclass(emibp$g), spec = "brake")
df <- data.frame(Emis = c(sapply(tyrew, sum), sapply(breakw, sum))*365/1000000)
df$Pollutant <- factor(x = names(tyrew), levels = names(tyrew))
df$Emissions <- c(rep("Tyre", 4), rep("Brake", 4))
ggplot(df, aes(x = Pollutant, y = Emis, fill = Emissions)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge")+
  labs(x = NULL, y = "[t/y]")
```

It is interesting to see that break emissions are higher than tyre wear emissions,
and the smalle the diameter, higher the difference, as shows:

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(sapply(breakw, sum) / sapply(tyrew, sum),
             caption = "Ratio between break and tyre wear emissions")
```

The procudure can be used with `emis_post` with `by  = streets_wide` to
obtain the spatial speciation.

## $NO$ and $NO_2$

The speciation of $NO_X$ into $NO$ and $NO2$ depends on the type of vehicle,
fuel and euro standard. The following example will consists in comparing
a Gasoline passenger car and a Diesel truck.

```{r}
library(vein)
data(net)
data(profiles)
propc <- profiles$PC_JUNE_2012[, 1] # 24 hours
prolt <- profiles$PC_JUNE_2012[, 1] # 24 hours
pweek <- temp_fact(net$ldv+net$hdv, pro)
df <- netspeed(pc_week, net$ps, net$ffs, net$capacity, net$lkm, alpha = 1)
euro <- c("V", rep("IV", 3),  
          rep("III", 7), rep("II", 7), rep("I", 5), rep("PRE", 27))
lefpc <- lapply(1:50, function(i) {
  ef_ldv_speed(v = "PC", t = "4S", cc = "<=1400", f = "G",
               eu = euro[i], p = "NOx", show.equation = FALSE) })
leflt <- lapply(1:50, function(i) {
  ef_hdv_speed(v = "Trucks", t = "RT", g = ">32", gr = 0,
               eu = euro[i], l = 0.5, p = "NOx", show.equation = FALSE) })
emipc <- emis(veh = age_ldv(net$ldv),lkm = net$lkm, ef = lefpc, speed = df,
              profile = profiles$PC_JUNE_2014[, 1])*365/1000000
emilt <- emis(veh = age_ldv(net$hdv),lkm = net$lkm, ef = leflt, speed = df,
              profile = profiles$HGV_JUNE_2014[, 1])*365/1000000
```

Then, once the emissions are estimated, we will speciate the emissions by euro standard. The estimation covered 24 hours and for simplicity, we are assuming
a year with 365 similar days and dividing by 1 million to have t/y.

```{r sno2}
df <- rowSums(apply(X = emipc, MARGIN = c(2,3), FUN = sum, na.rm = TRUE))
dfpc <-   rbind(speciate(df[1], "nox", "PC", "G", "V"),
                speciate(df[2:4], "nox", "PC", "G", "V"),
                speciate(df[5:11], "nox", "PC", "G", "V"),
                speciate(df[12:18], "nox", "PC", "G", "V"),
                speciate(df[19:23], "nox", "PC", "G", "V"),
                speciate(df[24:50], "nox", "PC", "G", "V"))
df <- rowSums(apply(X = emipc, MARGIN = c(2,3), FUN = sum, na.rm = TRUE))
dfhdv <-   rbind(speciate(df[1], "nox", "HDV", "D", "V"),
                 speciate(df[2:4], "nox", "HDV", "D", "V"),
                 speciate(df[5:11], "nox", "HDV", "D", "V"),
                 speciate(df[12:18], "nox", "HDV", "D", "V"),
                 speciate(df[19:23], "nox", "HDV", "D", "V"),
                 speciate(df[24:50], "nox", "HDV", "D", "V"))

df <- data.frame(rbind(sapply(dfpc, sum), sapply(dfhdv, sum)))
row.names(df) <- c("PC", "HGV")
knitr::kable(df, caption = "NO2 and NO speciation (t/y)")
```

## Volatile organic compounds: `nmhc`

nmhc were shown earluier in this chapter, but they can be also used to
speciate objects, resulting in all species at once. The speciation of NMHC must
be applied to NMHC. However, the emission guidelines of 
-@NtziachristosSamaras2016 does not show explicit emission factor of NMHC and
the suggeted procedure is substract the $CH_4$ from the $HC$. This was done on 
VEIN and now, ef_speed* functions returns NMHC directly. This makes easier to
produce speciation.


```{r}
library(vein)
data(net)
data(profiles)
propc <- profiles$PC_JUNE_2012[, 1] # 24 hours
pweek <- temp_fact(net$ldv+net$hdv, propc)
df <- netspeed(pweek, net$ps, net$ffs, net$capacity, net$lkm, alpha = 1)
euro <- c("V", rep("IV", 3),  
          rep("III", 7), rep("II", 7), rep("I", 5), rep("PRE", 27))
lefpc <- lapply(1:50, function(i) {
  ef_ldv_speed(v = "PC", t = "4S", cc = "<=1400", f = "G",
               eu = euro[i], p = "NMHC", show.equation = FALSE)})
```





```{r}
euro <- c("V", rep("IV", 3),  
          rep("III", 7), rep("II", 7), rep("I", 5), rep("PRE", 27))
lefpc <- lapply(1:length(euro), function(i) {
  ef_ldv_speed(v = "PC", t = "4S", cc = "<=1400", f = "G",
               eu = euro[i], p = "HC", show.equation = FALSE) })
enmhc <- emis(veh = age_ldv(net$ldv), lkm = net$lkm, ef = lefpc, speed = df,
              profile = profiles$PC_JUNE_2014[, 1])

df_enmhc <- emis_post(arra = enmhc, veh = "PC", size = "ALL", fuel = "G",
                      pollutant = "NMHC", by = "veh")
# assuming all euro I
spec <- speciate(x = as.numeric(df_enmhc$g), spec = "nmhc", veh = "LDV",
                 fuel = "G", eu = "I")
names(spec)
```


## The speciation `iag`

The Carbon Bond Mechanism Z [-@cbmz] is an lumped-structure mechanism.

Citing:

**"it is currently unfeasible to treat the organic species individually in a regional or global chemistry model for three major reasons:**

**- (1) limited computational resources,**
**- (2) lack of detailed speciated emissions inventories, and **
**- (3) lack of kinetic and mechanistic information for all the species and their reaction products.**

**Thus there exists a need for a condensed mechanism that is capable of describing the tropospheric hydrocarbon chemistry with reasonable accuracy, sensitivity, and speed at regional to global scales. **


The research in this aspect is intense and out of the scope of this book. 
However, it is important that the user who intends to performs atmospheric
simulation to understand this why it is important to speciate the emissions
and what represent each group. 

A popular air quality model nowedays is the Weather Research and Forecasting
model coupled to Chemistry (WRF-Chem) [@Grelletal2005] https://ruc.noaa.gov/wrf/wrf-chem/and the **Emissions Guide** (https://ruc.noaa.gov/wrf/wrf-chem/Emission_guide.pdf).


The speciation `iag` splits the NMHC into the lumped groups for the mechanism
CMB-Z. The name `iag` comes from the Institute of Astronomy, Geophysics and
Atmospheric Sciences (IAG, http://www.iag.usp.br/) from the University of São Paulo (USP). The Departament of Atmospheric Sciences (DAC) of IAG has measure
and model air quality models for  several years. There are several scientific 
production such as:
-@Nogueiraetal2015, -@HOSHYARIPOUR2016365, -@Andradeetal2017, 
-@Freitasetal2005, -@martins2006emission, -@perez2014emission,
-@ulke2001modeling, -@vivanco2006validation, -@boian2012characterization,
-@Andrade2012, -@Andradeetal2015, -@VaraVelaetal2015, -@Rafee2015,
-@Ibarraetal2017b. The following figure, shows an air quality simulation over 
South Easth Brazil from DAC/IAG/USP.

```{r echo= FALSE, fig.cap="http://www.lapat.iag.usp.br/aerossol/wrf9/index.php"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figuras/wrf.png")
```

Some of these papers show measurements in tunnels, fuel, etc. The speciation
`iag` it is based on these experiments, and the last versions, covers an
update during 2015 so that the exhaust emissions speciation is more
representative of brazilian gasoline. This means that:

- ** THE SPECIATION `IAG` IS BASED ON BRAZILIAN MEASUREMENTS**.

and the user who wants to applt it outside Brazil, should be ensure, that 
the fleet and fuel are compatible. As that will be hard to accomplish,
I can say that this speciation is for and to be used in Brazil, even more, in
São Paulo.

The currently speciation `iag` is:

```{r echo= FALSE, fig.cap="Speciation for NMHC by type of fuel and process mol/100g (Ibarra-Espinosa, S., 2017)"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figuras/iag1.png")
```


The arguments of the function `speciate` take the following form:

- `x`: Emissions estimation, it is recommended that x are griddded emissions
from NMHC.
- `spec`: `iag`. Alternatively, you can put any name of the following:
"e_eth", "e_hc3", "e_hc5", "e_hc8", "e_ol2", "e_olt", "e_oli", "e_iso", 
"e_tol", "e_xyl", "e_c2h5oh", "e_hcho", "e_ch3oh", "e_ket"
- `veh`: When spec is "iag" veh can take two values depending: when the
speciation is for vehicles veh accepts "veh", eu "Evaporative", "Liquid" or
"Exhaust"
- `fuel`:  "G", "E" or "D".
- `eu`: "Exhaust" "Evaporative" or "Liquid". 
- `show`: Let this FALSE.
- `list`: Let this TRUE so that the result is a list, and each element of the
list a lumped specie.

Example:

```{r}
# Do not run
x <- data.frame(x = rnorm(n = 100, mean = 400, sd = 2))
dfa <- speciate(x, spec = "e_eth", veh = "veh", fuel = "G", eu = "Exhaust")
head(dfa)
df <- speciate(x, spec = "iag", veh = "veh", fuel = "G",
               eu = "Exhaust", list = TRUE)
names(df)
for(i in 1:length(df)){
  print(df[[i]][1:3, ]) # Firt three lines of each element of the list
}
```


## The speciation `pmiag`

The speciation `pmiag`is also based on IAG studies and applied only for PM2.5
emissions. The speciation splits the PM2.5 in percentages  as follow:

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(x = data.frame(E_SO4i = 0.0077, E_SO4j = 0.0623, E_NO3i = 0.00247,
                            E_NO3j = 0.01053, E_MP2.5i = 0.1, E_MP2.5j = 0.3, 
                            E_ORGi = 0.0304, E_ORGj = 0.1296, E_ECi = 0.056, 
                            E_ECj = 0.024, H2O = 0.277),
             caption = "Speciation of PM2.5")
```

When running this speciation, the only two required arguments are `x` and
`spec`. Also, There is a message that this speciation applies **only
in gridded emissions, because the unit must be in flux $g/km^2/h$**, and
internally are transformed to the required unit $ \mu g/m^2/s$ as:

$$ \frac{g}{(km)^2*h}*\frac{10^6 \mu g}{g}*(\frac{km}{1000m})^2*\frac{h}{3600s}\frac{1}{dx^2}$$

dx is the length of the grid cell.
Example:
```{r}
library(vein)
data(net)
pm <- data.frame(pm = rnorm(n = length(net), mean = 400, sd = 2))
net@data <- pm
g <- make_grid(net, 1/102.47/2) # 500 m
gx <- emis_grid(net, g)
df <- speciate(gx, spec = "pmiag", veh = "veh", fuel = "G",
               eu = "Exhaust", list = FALSE, dx = 0.5)
names(df)
head(df)
```

# Inputs for atmospheric models {#ep}

This last chapter of this book is about generating inputs for atmospheric
models, specifically, **WRF-Chem** [@Grelletal2005]. As the Pacific Northwest 
National Laboratory (PNNL, https://www.pnnl.gov/atmospheric/research/wrf-chem/)
defines:


**The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model is a next generation **
**meteorological model being developed collaboratively among several agencies**
**(NOAA/NCEP, NOAA/ESRL, NCAR). WRF-Chem is a version of WRF that also**
**simultaneously simulates the emission, turbulent mixing, transport,**
**transformation, and fate of trace gases and aerosols.**

Initially, VEIN counted with the function `emis_wrf` which created a data.frame
object of hourly gridded emissions with each pollutant as a column, from the
first cell to the last. The data-frame extendend in long format to each hour.
This data.frame was designed to be used with script Another Asimilation
System for WRF (AS4WRF) [@VaraVelaetal2015] written in NCL [@ncl]. 

This approach was effective and already tested for some Latinamerican cities
[@micro], [@icshmo]. However, this function depends on external software which
may not be available. Therefore, me andsome collegues developed the package
`eixport` [@eixport], [@eixport2], which is an R package to read and export
emissions to atmospheric models. `eixport` currently covers the models
WRF-Chem [@Grelletal2005], SPM-BRAMS [@Freitasetal2005] and R-LINE [@rline], but
only the WRF-Chem interface has been fully implemented. Therefore, this chapter
covers only this model.

The concept of connecting VEIN and Wrf-Chem via eixport is quite simple with
two approaches:

1. Generating `GriddedEmissionsArray` for the wrfinput grid and inputting this
emissions into the wrfchemi input file..
2. Generating gridded emissions data-frame for AS4WRF.

## WRFChem input with wrfinput and `GriddedEmissionsArray`

```{r 9.1, eval = FALSE, include = FALSE}
library(DiagrammeR)

p1 <- grViz("digraph boxes_and_circles {
      graph [overlap = false,
            fontsize = 10,

      node [shape = box,
            style = filled,
            fixedsize = false,
            fillcolor = white,
            color = black,
            fontcolor = black,

      wrfinput_d0x;
      wrfcheminput;

      node [shape = box,

            fillcolor = grey88,
            color = black,
            fontcolor = black,
            fontize = 12]
      make_grid;
      emis_grid;
      emis_post;
      emis_merge;
 
      node [shape = box,
            style = filled,
            fixedsize = false,
            fillcolor = green,
            color = black,
            fontcolor = black,
            fontize = 12]
      wrf_create;
      wrf_put;

      edge [color = black,
            arrowhead = vee,
            penwidth = 1.5]
      wrfinput_d0x -> {make_grid wrf_create}
      EmissionsArray -> emis_post
      emis_post -> emis_merge
      {make_grid emis_merge} -> {emis_grid}
      emis_grid -> GriddedEmissionsArray
      GriddedEmissionsArray -> wrf_put
      {wrf_put wrf_create} -> wrfcheminput
      }
      ")
```

The process for generation WRF-Chem input files with `GriddedEmissionsArray` is
shown on Fig. \@ref(fig:gea). Pink boxes are classes, grey boxes are `vein`
functions, green functions are  `eixport` functions and white boxes, external
objects. Here, the external input file is the **wrfinputd_0x**
file, where the **x** is for the domain. This file is inputted into the function
`make_grid` which creates a polygon grid needed by `emis_grid`. The main
characteristic of this grid, is that it has the resolution of the wrfinput
file.

The wrfinpiut_d0x file isalso used by the `eixport` function `wrf_create` to
create a wrfchemi input file with zeroes.

The objects with class `EmissionsArray` for each type of vehicle and pollutant are 
processed by the function `emis_post` which create street emissions. Then, the function
`emis_merge` merges all the street emissions files from `emis_post_ into one
street emissions by pollutant ehich is inputted into function `emis_grid` to
create a polygon grid of emissions, class Spatial Feature `sf` [@sf], [@RJ-2018-009].
Then, the spatial gridded emissions are inputted into the contructor function
`GriddedEmissionsArray` to create an object of that class, and the dimensions
of the wrfinput file, that is, the sanem number of spatial rows and columns.

Finally, the `GriddedEmissionsArray` objects are inputted into the wrfchemi
file with the `eixport` function `wrf_put`.

```{r gea, echo = FALSE, fig.cap='Generation of wrfchem inputs using GriddedEmissionsArray', out.width='50%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}

```

Example

### Creating a WRF-Chem input file

The emission file will be generated with traffic simulation from the 
Traffic Engineering Company (CET) for 2012, which consists
in traffic flow for morning rush hour of Light Duty Vehicles (LDV).
The emission factors will be the data `fe2015`
and the wrfinput comes from the `eixport` package. Let's go:

#### 0) Network

The object net has a class `SpatialLinesDataFrame`, we transform it into a
`sf`object. The length of the road is the field 'lkm' in the object net, which
are in km but has no units. We must add the right units in order to use `vein`


```{r include = FALSE}
require(vein)
require(sf)
require(units)
```


```{r 9.3, eval = FALSE}
require(vein)
require(sf)
require(units)
net <- readRDS("figuras/net.rds")
class(net)
net <- sf::st_as_sf(net)
net[1, ]
net$lkm <- units::set_units(st_length(net), km) # ensure right units
```


#### 1) Vehicular composition

In this case, the vehicular composition consits in only to vehicles, Passenger
Cars using Gasoline with 25\% of Ethanol and Light Trucks consuming Diesel with 
5\% od biodiesel. Also, the emission factors cover $CO$. The
temporal distribution will cover only one hour.

```{r 9.4, eval = FALSE}
PC_E25 <- age_ldv(net$ldv)
```

#### 2) Emission factors

The emission factors used comes from -@CETESB2015, which are constant by age of use.
In practice, this data.frame is like an Excel spreadsheet. Then, the constructor
function `EmissionFactorsList` convert our numeric vector, which is the column
of our data.frame, into required type of object of the `emis` function. Parenthesis
were added in order to print the objects in one line.

```{r 9.5, eval = FALSE}
data(fe2015)
(EF_CO_PC_E25 <- EmissionFactorsList(fe2015[fe2015$Pollutant == "CO", "PC_G"]))
```
#### 3) Estimation of emissions

The estimation of emissions is shown in the following code chunk in a simplified
way. The emissions array are aggregated.

```{r 9.6, eval = FALSE}
data(profiles)
emi <- emis(veh = PC_E25, lkm = net$lkm, ef = EF_CO_PC_E25,
             profile = profiles$PC_JUNE_2012)
```

#### 4) Post-estimations

The resulting emissions array `emi` is now processed with `emis_post`.

```{r 9.7, eval = FALSE}
co_street <- emis_post(arra = emi, by = "streets_wide", net = net)
```


#####  4a WRFChem input file with `eixport`

Now it is time generate the emissions grid. In order to create a wrfchem input
file, we need a wrfinput file. In this case, the wrfinput coversa wider area
of the emissions, located in São Paulo, Brazil. The wrfinput file is available
from the R package `eixport`.

```{r include=FALSE}
co_street <- readRDS("figuras/co_street.rds")
```


```{r 9.8}
wrf <- paste(system.file("extdata", package = "eixport"),
             "/wrfinput_d02", sep="")
g  <- make_grid(wrf)
plot(st_geometry(g), axes = TRUE)
plot(st_geometry(co_street), add = TRUE)
```

Notice that weh we create grid from the path to wrfinput, there is a message
with *Number of lat points 51* and *Number of lon points 63*. This information
is crytical for later conversions. Now that we have the street emissions and the
grid, we can obtain our gridded emissions:

```{r 9.9}
gCO <- emis_grid(spobj = co_street, g = g)
names(gCO)
gCO$geometry
```

This function requires the package `lwgeom` when the data is in latitude and
longitude degrees. There are some messages about the total emissions of 
street and grid. This was made in order to ensure that emis_grid is conservative.
The resulting object `gCO` is an `sf` object of POLYGON. In order to plot the
emissions, i selected the emissions above 1, because it is easier to see the 
plot. If we plot the gridded emissions, we will see:


```{r GEmi, fig.cap="Gridded emissions (mol/h)"}
gCO$V9 <- gCO$V9*(12 + 16)^-1
plot(gCO[gCO$V9 >1, "V9"], axes = TRUE,  nbreaks = 50,
     pal = cptcity::cpt(colorRampPalette = T),
     main = "Emissions of CO at 08:00 (mol/h)")
```

The emissions are mostly distributed into main roads, as expected. The next step
is create the `GriddedEmissionsArray` that will be inputted into the `eixport`
functions. The `GriddedEmissionsArray` is a contructor function that reads
class, `SpatialPolygonDataFrame`, `sf` of POLYGONs, a `data.frame` or a `matrix`
to create an Array of the gridded emissions. The dimensions are lat, lon, mass
and time. Therefore, it is important to know the number of lat and lon points!

```{r GEA, fig.cap="GriddedEmissionsArray (mol/h)"}
gCOA <- GriddedEmissionsArray(x = gCO, cols = 63, rows = 51, times = 168)
plot(gCOA, col = cptcity::cpt())
```

The image is similar to the plot of the gridded emissions, which means that it
is correct. Now we can input the our new created object `gCOA` into the wrfchem
input file, but first, we need to create it. This is done using the `eixport`
functions.

We first load the library `eixport`. Then load the data `emis_opt` which has the
emissions options for WRFchem. In this case, we are creating an wrfchem input
file with 40 pollutants, with 0.

```{r 9.12, eval = FALSE}
library(eixport)
data(emis_opt)
emis_opt[["ecb05_opt1"]]
wrf_create(wrfinput_dir = system.file("extdata", package = "eixport"),
           wrfchemi_dir = tempdir(),
           frames_per_auxinput5 = 168,
           domains = 2,
           variaveis = emis_opt[["ecb05_opt1"]],
           verbose = F)

```

The wrfchemi input file was created on a temporal directory with the function
`tempdir`. Now we can input our `GriddedEmissionsArray` into our new
wrfchem input file.

```{r 9.13, eval = FALSE}
f <- list.files(path = tempdir(), full.names = T, pattern = "wrfchemi_d02")
f
wrf_put(file = f, name = "E_CO", POL = gCOA)
```

Then, we just check our resulting NetCDF file plotting the emissions we just put.

```{r Fwrf, eval = FALSE}
wrf_plot(f, "E_CO")
```

```{r wrf,  echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Wrfchem input file (NetCDF) (mol/h)", out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figuras/wrf2.png")

```

##### 4b WRFChem input file with `emis_wrf`

`emis_wrf` creates a `data.frame` with columns lat, long, id, pollutants, local time 
and GMT time. This dataframe has the proper format to be used with WRF assimilation 
system: "ASimilation System 4 WRF (AS4WRF, -@angel)

```{r 9.16}
args(emis_wrf)
```


where:

- `sdf`: Gridded emissions, which can be a SpatialPolygonsDataFrame, or a list of 
SpatialPolygonsDataFrame, or a sf object of "POLYGON". The user must enter a list with
36 SpatialPolygonsDataFrame with emissions for the mechanism CBM-Z.
- `nr`: Number of repetitions of the emissions period
- `dmyhm`: String indicating Day Month Year Hour and Minute in the format "d-m-Y H:M" 
e.g.: "01-05-2014 00:00" It represents the time of the first hour of emissions in 
Local Time
- `tz`: Time zone as required in for function as.POSIXct
- `crs`: Coordinate reference system, e.g: "+init=epsg:4326". Used to transform the coordinates of the output
- `islist`: logical value to indicate if sdf is a list or not
- `utc`: ignored.

In this case, we can use our gridded emissions directly here:

```{r 9.17}
gCO$id <- NULL
df <- emis_wrf(sdf = gCO, dmyhm = "06-10-2014 00:00",
               tz = "America/Sao_Paulo", islist = FALSE)
head(df)
```

Then you must export this `data.frame` into a .txt file. You must include
the number of columns to match your luped species and also take out the columns
time_lt, time_utc and dutch. These three columns are just informative.

```{r 9.18}
df <- df[,1:4]
write.table(x = df, file = tempfile(), sep = "\t",
            col.names = TRUE, row.names = FALSE)
```

Finally, in order to generate the wrfchem input file, you must have the 
resulting .txt file, a wrfinput file with the same grid spacing, the NCL
script AS4WRF and a namelist. AS4WRF and the namelist can be obtained contacting
angel.vela@iag.usp.br and alvv1986@gmail.com.


```{r include=FALSE}
rm(list = ls())
```

# Quality check and errors {#check}

This last chapter of this book presents to aspestcs fthat must be considered
for any practicioner interested in developing emissions inventories. The first
part covers a summary of the EMEP/EEA air pollutant emission inventory 
guidebook 2016, Technical guidance to prepare national emission inventories
[@guia], based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
2006 Good Practice Guidance [@change20062006. The second part consists in 
advices and specific considerations for avoinding errors when runnign VEIN in 
each part of the inventory.

## Guidance from EMEP/EEA air pollutant emission inventory guidebook

I believe that this part of this capter delivers knowledge that you really
will gain with experience. But even with experience you can get lost, and 
returning to this part would save you. This part is based on the EMEP/EEA air 
pollutant emission inventory guidebook [@guia].


### Key categories

Key categories are the most important  **source** categories. This section is based
on the chapter Key category analysis and methodological choice [@guiak] of the 
EMEP/EEA air pollutant emission  inventory guidebook 2013. They are important 
because they are responsabile for most of pollution in a determined region.
For instance, it has been described that vehicles are the most important
source of pollution in mega-cities [@molina2004megacities]. Evenmore, in the 
case of São Paulo, the official emissions inventory informs that vehicles are
responsabiel for mor than `r round(100*162.90/167.08)` \% of $CO$,
`r round(100*34.82/44.1)` \% of $HC$, `r round(100*54.33/80.43)` \% of $NO_X$,
and only `r round(100*1.48/5.05)` \% of $PM$ and `r round(100*1.56/7.15)` \% of
$SO_X$ [@CETESB2015]. This shown another characteristics of key categories:
they depend of specific pollutants.

For another example, consider a city which suffers cold weather with use
bio-mass burning for cooking and heating. The main source of $PM_{2.5}$ will
be certainly bio-mass burning.

Now consider an industrial region with industrial process that emit too much
$SO_X$. The key-cateogries might be industrial sources.

And one more example, consider a huge mega-city with electric mobility. However,
the main source of electricity are thermoelectric based on carbon (the key).

This implies that it should be a nomemclature for categorizing and naming sources.
IPCC, has a nomenclature for instance.

The ideia behind key categories, is that most efforts must be applied in this
categories, obtainging the highest level of detail with less uncertainty. Hence,
the emissions guidelines [@guia] proposes three levels of complexity estimation
methods, known as Tier Methods. The complexity increases from level 1, 2 and 3.
The VEIN tier is 3, which is that the most complex function of vehicular
emissions estimations are incporated, with the exception of evaporative.
I need to improve that part.

- Tier 1: a simpler method which include available activity and emissions factors.
- Tier 2: Similar to Tier 1, but includes more specific emission factors.
- Tier 3: Most complex methodologies with higher level of detail, temporal
and spatial.

### Uncertainty

This is a very important part in any emissions inventory and a dedicated chapter
or section should be made in any report/paper. This section is based on the 
chapter Uncertainties [@guiau] of the EMEP/EEA air pollutant emission inventory
guidebook 2013.The 2006 IPCC Guidelines chapter states that estimating the 
uncertainty of an inventory is needed [@change20062006].

It is recommended to use 95% confidence interval. This means that:

- there is a  95% of probability that the actual value of the quantity estimates
is within the interval defined by the confidence interval.
- The probability of the actual value will be outside the range it is 5%.

The general form for estimating emissions was shown on Eq. \@ref(eq:efGERAL) [@guiau].
This equation will be the base for calculating the uncertainty. This section
is applied when measurements are made, for the case of activity or emission
factors. In those case, it is possible calculate the required confiden intervals.

#### Default uncertainty ranges

_Activity data_

The following table is taking directly form -@guia and propose indicative
ranges that could be applies in cases where no independed data are available.

- National official statistics: - .
- Update of last year's statistics using Gross Economic Growth factors: 0 - 2%.
- International Energy Agency (IEA) statistics: OECD: 2 - 3%, non-OECD 5-10%.
- United Nation data bases: 5 - 10%.
- Default values, other sources: 30 - 100%.

_Emission factors_

The following table is taking directly form -@guia and propose rating definitions
for emission factors[@guia].

- A: An estimate based on a large number of measurements made at a large number of facilities that fully represent the sector. Error: 10 o 30%.
- B: An estimate based on a large number of measurements made at a large number of facilities that represent a large part of the sector. Error: 20 to 60%
- C: An estimate based on a number of measurements made at a small number of representative facilities, or an engineering judgement based on a number of relevant facts. Error: 50 to 200%.
- D: An estimate based on single measurements, or an engineering calculation derived from a number of relevant facts. Error: 100 to 300%.
- E: An estimate based on an engineering calculation derived from assumptions only. Error: Order of magnitude.

Uncertainties can be aggregated with two approaches

- _Rule A_: uncertainties are combined by _addition_, as shown in Eq. \@ref(eq:sumun):

\begin{equation}
U_{total}=\frac{\sqrt{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}(U_i \cdot x_i )^2}}{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}}
(\#eq:sumun)
\end{equation}

Where, $x$ are the quantities, $U_i$ are the uncertain quantities and the percentage 
uncertainties (half the 95% confidence interval) associated with them, respectivly.
$U_{total}$ is the percentage uncertinti in the sum of the quantites (half the
95% confidence interval divided by the total (i.e. mean) and expressed as
percentage).

- _Rule B_: uncertainties are combined by _multiplication_, as shown on Eq. \@ref(eq:sumul):

\begin{equation}
U_{total}=\sqrt{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}(U_i)^2} 
(\#eq:sumul)
\end{equation}

Where, $U_i$ are the percentage quantities (hal the 95% confidence interval) 
associated with each of the quantities. $U_{total}$ is the percentage in the
product of the quantities (half the 95% confidence interval divided by the total
and expressed as percentage).

Alternatively, a Monte Carlo simulation can be done.

### Quality Assurance and Quality Check

This section is mostly based on the chapter Inventory management, improvement and 
QA/QC [@guiaqa] of the EMEP/EEA air pollutant emission inventory  guidebook 2013.

According to Wikipedia:

- **Quality assurance (QA)** is a way of preventing mistakes and defects 
in manufactured products and avoiding problems when delivering solutions or 
services to customers [@wiki:qa].
- **Quality control (QC)** is a process by which entities review the quality of 
all factors involved in production [@wiki:qc].

The main reference in QA/QC are the International Organization for 
Standardization ISO 9000 [@wiki:iso].

The idea is to avoid errors in the development of the inventory. Hence, it is 
very important that the objective of the inventory, frequency and spatial
and temporal resolution must be very clear. As mentioned before, the inventory
can have a purpose of policy application or scientific. In any case, the QAQC 
procedures should be explicitly stated covering five data quality objectives
**transparency**, **consistency**, **comparability**, **completeness** and **acccuracy**. 

This means that another researcher/practicioner should be able to reproduce the results.
However, this is not always the case. Evenmore, it has been shown that there 
are currently a crisis of reproducibility in science, where 'more than 70% of 
researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist's experiments,
and more than half have failed to reproduce their own experiments' [@baker2016there]. 
I believe that emissions inventories should guarantee the reproducibility of results,
in scientific and policy application inventories.

### Inventory managment cycle

Another important aspect is the inventory managment cycle. The inventory manager
is responsabile for institutional arrangments, meet deadlines and for the inventory managment cycle. The inventory complier gets the data and estimate the emissions
with the respective Tier. 

The cycle is: 

1. Priorization of improvements: As the resources are limited, priorization must
be given to key categories.
2. Data-collection: It is important to stablish formal agreements needs with
data providers using protocols. The protocols must cleary show the data needed,
its format, content and dates of delivery.
3. Inventory compilation. The inventory compiler estimate the emissions.
4. Consolidation. The inventory manager consolidates all the emissions ensuring
quality in data and methods for estimating emissions.
5. Data Quality Review. 
6. Reporting. 
7. Lessons learned and improvement review.
8. Inventory Managment Report.
9. Quality Assurance and Quality Control Plan.


## Avoiding errors with VEIN

The first part of this chapter covered some fundamental aspects in emissions
inventory managment for quality assurance and quality control. This part
covers typical erros that I've faced using VEIN and I hope it help users
how to avoid them.

Currently, VEIN does not have grafical user interface (GUI) and runs on R [@R],
which  can be intimidating for new users. Also, even experienced users can do
mistakes. If you find a mistake, write it down to abooid it in future. Be organized.
I recommend to code your inventory keeping in mind that you will have to check your
scripts in the future, so it would be nice if in the first try your code looks
nice. And also, don't panic.

### Traffic flow

One of the first inputs of it is the traffic flow data. You must have an agreement
with data providers to get the data. Also, the compiler must understand the format of 
the data. In my experience, data providers comes from government agencies with limitated
resources and few time. This means that, if there is not a formal agreement, they
won't speed too much time for processing their data to meet your needs (because it
is not part of their jobs). And even, if there was a formal agreement, the data
processing must be done by the data compiler.

The data provided in this book covers a travel demand output for Metropolitan
Are ofSão Paulo (MASP) made by the Traffic Company Engineering of São Paulo, for the 
year 2012. The has the same content inside VEIN package, with the exception
that covers the whole MASP. The data originally is in format MAPINFO. Therefore,
the package **sf** must be used to read the data.

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(sf)
net <- st_read("data/masp.TAB")
```

The section \@ref(#traffic) shows details about this data. 

- Have a meeting with data delivers to check and solve any doubt regarding 
the data.
- Check if your data is projected or not. The data probably will be projected
with a UTM zone, for instance code 31983 http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/sirgas-2000-utm-zone-23s/. VEIN imports
functions from `sf` and `lwgeom` which depend on GEOS libraries. This means that
VEIN can work with data projected or not. Nevertheless, I suggest to work
with projected data for your location.
- Ensure that the data is correctly read and that there are no objects of class 
`factor` in the columns.
- Make sure that of what are the units of the traffic flow and remember that
most of VEIN functions are designed to work with hourly traffic flow.
- Plot the data. Check if the data looks fine or have some mistakes.
- Calculate the length of each road. Make proper transformations and **make sure**
**that resulting length of road as `units` km**. I suggest to use the name lkm. 
This can be easily done with in R with packages `sf` and `units` installed. 
Let's say that your data is named _net_ and your data is already projected. Also,
that your traffic flow is named _ldv_ for light duty vehicles and _hdv_ for heavy
duty vehicles.

```{r eval = FALSE}
plot(net["ldv"], axes = T)
plot(net["hdv"], axes = T)
net$lkm <- sf::st_length(net) #returns distance in meters
net$$lkm <- units::set_units(net$lkm, km) #transform meters in km
```

Despite that this transformation can be done by dividing lkm by 1000, this would
be wrong because the `units` wouldn't change and they must be `km`. Hence, using
the functions of the `units` package is the recommended way.

### Vehicular composition

The vehicular composition is a critical part in the emissions inventories for
vehicles. It consists in the percentage of each type of vehicle and technology.
Despite that it seems pretty straightforward, making a mistake in this part
of the emissions inventories would cost lots of time. **Developing an**
**emissions inventory is a complex task, you must take great care in simple**
**calculations, because if the resutls are not consistent, it can take LOTS**
**of time, to find the error, usually when the dealines are dead**.

The function `inventory` needs the vehicular composition to create the respective
directories to run VEIN. I have the feeling that most of model users like 
structured models with clear input and outputs. VEIN is not like that, and this
is in part due to the nature of the emissions inventories. I could  design a 
model that works perfectly with one type of input, but in real life, a desired
input is not always easy to get. For instance, the traffic simulation used inside
the model is not easy to get, even in cities of developed countries. Hence,
the inventory compiler must struggle to do their job. Therefore, VEIN was
designed with flexibility and verstility on mind.

Anyways, the vehicular composition are the number of each type the following 
vehicles: PC, LCV, HGB, BUS, MC. Then, each sub category will be divided
by type of age of use. For instance, the vehicular emissions inventory for
São Paulo State considers 4 type of vehicles:

- Particulate Cars using gasohol (Gasoline with 25% of ethanol, PC_25).
- Particulate Cars Flex using gasohol (Gasoline with 25% of ethanol, PC_F25).
- Particulate Cars Flex using ethanol (Gasoline with 25% of ethanol, PC_FE100).
- Particulate Cars using ethanol (Gasoline with 25% of ethanol, PC_E100).

This means that the number of PC is 4.

Then each of this vehicles is divided by age of use. As consecuence, we must
know when each of these vehicle entered and went out of the market. Again,
for São Paulo conditions, Flex engines entered into market in 2003 and nowadays
must of new cars are flex. Vehicles with engines designed for burning ethanol
had a peak in early 80s, but they went of the market in 2006. Gasoline vehicles
have been in circulation from the beginning and CETESB inventory considers a
life span of 40 years of use.

The same analyses must be done with each of the vehicle categories.

The distribution by age of use indirectly shows the technology associated with
emission standards by age of use.


<!-- A few days ago, I was developing an inventory in which my team was evaluating -->
<!-- the impact in air quality of a new type of fuel on the city of São Paulo. The -->
<!-- results were consistens comparison base case with scenario, however, the magnitud  -->
<!-- of the emissions are too high. The air quality simulatiosn showed a clear  -->
<!-- bias, constant over time. I struggled to find any error without results. -->
<!-- Until I remembered the words of my former boss _Plot the results, becaust it is_ -->
<!-- _easier fo find any mistake_. I did it, and this is was the result. -->

### Units

Currently, VEIN checks that the variable lkm (length) must be in km. This is
to avoid that the user wrongly enter length in meters or without units. As a 
result, the emissions woult be huge and wrong.

In the case of vehicles, currently there are not designed a unit of "vehicles" in
VEIN. In transportation studies, it is used the unit "equivalent vehicle" which
standarize each type of vehicle by its size. For instance, LCV are sometimes
equivalent of 1.2 vehicles. Buses or HGV can be equuvalent to 2 or more vehicles.
however, there are no such typeof this things in VEIN and units managment is 
designed to control emission factors and length.

The temporal dimension is also an aspect difficult to handle regarding the units.
This is because, sometimes mileage are correctly in km, but the timespan is in 
one year. Threfore, the units magament is degined to avoid errors with emission
factors and calculation of emissions. This means that a future version of VEIN
will erradicate all temporal dimensions ensure right calculation of mass only.
This means that VEIN will not chech if the data is hourly or anunual.


### Emission factors

When I started this book, VEIN contained few emission factors. Now, the version
`r packageVersion("vein")` has all the 2016 emission factors of CETESB,
almost 100 emisision factors from the European Emission guidelines
the all the BASE emission factors from the International Vehicle Model (IVE). The
functions to access this data are:

- ef_cetesb.
- ef_ldv_speed.
- ef_hdv_speed.
- ef_ive.

I will be working to import emission factors from HBEFA model which are based
traffic situation (very cool).


### Deterioration

VEIN currently cover the deterioration emission factors from the Euroepan 
emission guidelines. This values results in a simply numeric vector
depending on standard, mileage, type of vehicle and pollutant. However,
it would be possible to use any other deterioation factors.

Ensure to use correctly the data and cite respective literature.

### Fuel evaluation

It is a good practice to ensure that the mass of fuel consumed of vehicle in your
study area, matchs the fuel sale son your area. If not, calibrate your emissions
by number of vehicles (if bottom-up) or a combination of vehicles and mileage 
(if top-down) to match fuel sales.

### Emissions estimation

Most of emission functions returns an array of emissions, which means a matrix
of matrices. The idea was that each dimension has a meaning but I've been
thinking that it is not necessary and each dimension should have different
nature, for instance, it is not necessary two dimensions for time, despite
that one indicates hour and the other days. So I mght change that in future. 
Dont panic, I'm always trying to change the functions without breaking older code.

I hope you liked this book.

## Vehicular composition [@CETESB2015]

The vehicular composition `vehcomp` has 5 types of vehicles: Passenger Carss (PC),
Light Commercial Vehicles (LCV), Heavy Good Vehicles or trucks (HGV), Buses (BUS),
and Motorcycles (MC). The default value of this argument is:
`c(PC = 4, LCV = 5, HGV = 5, BUS = 3, MC = 9)`, which means that there are 4
types of PC, 5 of LCV, 5 of trucks, 3 of buses and 9 types of motorcycles. This
composition comes from the vehicular emissions inventory of the Environmental
Agency of São Paulo, Brazil [@CETESB2015]. In Brazil, the fuel used in vehicles
is blended with ethanol with and biodiesel. The user can use **any** vehicular
composition that representes its fleet with up-to 99 type of vehicles per
category. The default composition according Brazilian emissions inventory
is:

_Passenger Cars (PC)_

1. Passenger Cars using Gasoline blended with 25\% of ethanol (E25).
1. Passenger Cars with Flex engine using Gasoline blended with 25\% of ethanol (FE25).
1. Passenger Cars with Flex engine using 100\% of ethanol (FE100).
1. Passenger Cars with engines that uses only ethanol (E100).


_Light Commercial Vehicles (LCV)_

1. Light Commercial Vehicles with gross weight (GW) less than 3.8 t using
Gasoline blended with 25\% of ethanol (E25).
1. Light Commercial Vehicles with GW less than 3.8 t with Flex engine using
Gasoline blended with 25\% of ethanol (FE25).
1. Light Commercial Vehicles  with GW less than 3.8 t with Flex engine using
100\% of ethanol (FE100).
1. Light Commercial Vehicles  with GW less than 3.8 t with engines that uses
only ethanol (E100).
1. Light Commercial Vehicles  with GW less than 3.8 t with engines that uses
only ethanol (E100).

_Heavy Good Vehicles (HGV) or Trucks_

1. Semi Light Trucks (SLT) with 3.8 t < GW < 6 t using Diesel blended with 5\%
of biodiesel (B5).
1. Light Trucks (LT) with 6 t < GW < 10 t using Diesel blended with 5\% of
biodiesel (B5).
1. Medium Trucks (MT) with 10 t < GW < 15 t using Diesel blended with 5\% of
biodiesel (B5).
1. Semi Heavy Trucks (SHT) with 15 t < GW on a Rigid Truck (RT)  and GW < 40 on
an Articulated Truck (AT) using Diesel blended with 5\% of bodiesel (B5).
1. Heavy Trucks (HT) with 15 t < GW on a RT  and GW >= 40 on an AT using Diesel
blended with 5\% of bodiesel (B5).


_Buses_

1. Urban Bus (UB) using Diesel blended with 5\% of biodiesel (B5).
1. Small Urban Bus (SUB) using Diesel blended with 5\% of biodiesel (B5).
1. Motorway Bus (MB) or Coach using Diesel blended with 5\% of biodiesel (B5).

_Motorcycles (MC)_

1. Motorcycles with engine cc < 150 using Gasoline blended with 25\% of ethanol
(E25).
1. Motorcycles with engine 150 < cc < 500 using Gasoline blended with 25\% of 
ethanol (E25).
1. Motorcycles with engine cc > 500 using Gasoline blended with 25\% of ethanol
(E25).
1. Motorcycles with engine cc < 150 with Flex engine using Gasoline blended

blended with 25\% of ethanol (FE25).
1. Motorcycles with engine cc > 500 with Flex engine using Gasoline blended
with 25\% of ethanol (FE25).
1. Motorcycles with engine cc < 150 with Flex engine using 100\% of ethanol
(FE100).
1. Motorcycles with engine 150 < cc < 500 with Flex engine using 100\% of
ethanol (FE100).
1. Motorcycles with engine cc > 500 with Flex engine using 100\% of ethanol
(FE100).

## Traffic data

The vehicular composition will split the traffic simulation as shown on next
table. The simulation has traffic for Light Duty Vehicles and Heavy Good
Vehicles, therefore, the vehicular composition must split this categories and
considerations:

- Passenger Cars (PC) = 75% of Light Duty Vehicles (LDV) of traffic simulation.
- Light Commercial Vehicles (LCV) = 10% of LDV of traffic simulation.
- Motorcycles (MC) = 15% of LDV on traffic simulation.
- Heavy Good Vehicles (HGV) = 75% of Heavy Duty Vehicles (HDV).
- Buses =  = 25% of Heavy Duty Vehicles (HDV).
- LCV and PC have vehicles with flex engines capable to run with any mixture of
gasoline and ethanol [@2005-01-4130].
- Type of fuel consumed consists in gasoline blended with 25% of ethanol (E25).
- The vehicular composition consists in type of vehicles and type of fuel.
Optionally, the user could have a wider vehicular composition considering more
sizes, gross weight, etc.
- The percentages in composition apply for each type of vehicle PC, LCV, HGV,
BUS and MC.

**Passenger Cars**

The vehicular composition consisted in PC using E25, PC with Flex engines using
E25 and E100, and OC with engines for consuming only E100. The PC with Flex
engines entered into Brazilian market in 2003, therefore, at year 2015 flex
vehicles has 13 years of use. On the other case, PC with engines for E100 went
out of the market in 2007, therefore, the newest PC with E100 engine has 9 years
of use.

```


**Light Commercial Vehicles**

The engine/fuel type affects in the same way to LCV with PC vehicles. However,
this category has a fraction of vehicles being driven with diesel. In Brazil,
all diesle is blended with approximatly 5% of biodiesel, then it is named as
B5. The categorization of the names in LCV is similar with PC.

**Buses**

In Brazil there are many type of buses, but in this book we are focussing in the
most abundandt: Urban Buses, Small Urban Buses and Motoreway Buses ro Coach.
According to the Secretary or Urban Mobility of São Paulo
(Sptrans, http://www.sptrans.com.br/), the fleet has an average age of use of
5 years and 5 monthts. To achieve this average age, the agemax of this vehicles
is 10 years of use.

```{r compbus, echo=FALSE}

  Vehicles = c("UB", "SUB", "MB")
  Composition = c("77.43%", "9.07%", "13.5%")
df <- data.frame(Vehicles, Composition)
knitr::kable(df, 
  caption = 'Vehicular composition of BUS for applied in this book',
  booktabs = TRUE,
  align = "c"
)
```




```{r eval = FALSE}
UB_B5 <- age_hdv(x = net$ldv,name = "UB_B5", agemax = 10,
                 k = 25/100*77.43)
SUB_B5 <- age_hdv(x = net$ldv, name = "SUB_B5", 
                  k = 25/100*9.07)
MB_B5 <- age_hdv(x = net$ldv, name = "MB_B5",
                 k = 25/100*13.5)

```



**Motorcycles**

The vehicular composition consisted in Motorcycles using E25, and recnetly,
in year 2010, entered into the market flex motorcycles, which can use
gasoline E25 or ethano E100. Therefore, the oldest flex MC is 6 years old.


```{r compmc, echo=FALSE}
