# Speciation {#he}

The speciation for emissions is a very important part that deserves a only chapter on this book. VEIN initially covered speed functions emission factors of CO, HC, NOx, PM and Fuel Consumption (FC). But currently, the the pollutants covered are:

- **Criteria**: "CO", "NOx", "HC", "PM", "CH4", "NMHC", "CO2", "SO2", "Pb", "FC" (Fuel Consumption).
- **Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) and Persisten Organic Pollutants (POP)**: "indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene", "benzo(k)fluoranthene", "benzo(b)fluoranthene", "benzo(ghi)perylene", "fluoranthene", "benzo(a)pyrene", "pyrene", "perylene",  "anthanthrene", "benzo(b)fluorene",
"benzo(e)pyrene", "triphenylene", "benzo(j)fluoranthene",
"dibenzo(a,j)anthacene", "dibenzo(a,l)pyrene", "3,6-dimethyl-phenanthrene", "benzo(a)anthracene", "acenaphthylene", "acenapthene", "fluorene", "chrysene", "phenanthrene", "napthalene",  "anthracene", "coronene", "dibenzo(ah)anthracene" 
- **Dioxins and Furans**: "PCDD", "PCDF", "PCB".
- **Metals**: "As", "Cd", "Cr", "Cu", "Hg", "Ni", "Pb", "Se", "Zn".

- _CYCLOALKANES_: "cycloalcanes".
- _ALKENES_: "ethylene", "propylene", "propadiene", "ONE_butene", "isobutene", "TWO_butene", "ONE_3_butadiene", "ONE_pentene", "TWO_pentene",
"ONE_hexene", "dimethylhexene".
- _ALKYNES_:"ONE_butine", "propine", "acetylene".
- _ALDEHYDES_: "formaldehyde", "acetaldehyde", "acrolein", "benzaldehyde", "crotonaldehyde", "methacrolein", "butyraldehyde", "isobutanaldehyde",
"propionaldehyde", "hexanal", "i_valeraldehyde", "valeraldehyde", "o_tolualdehyde", "m_tolualdehyde", "p_tolualdehyde".

Also, some Brazilian emission factors and speciations for WRF-Chem, mechanisms: "e_eth", "e_hc3", "e_hc5", "e_hc8", "e_ol2", "e_olt", "e_oli", "e_iso", "e_tol",
"e_xyl", "e_c2h5oh", "e_ald", "e_hcho", "e_ch3oh", "e_ket",  "E_SO4i", "E_SO4j", "E_NO3i", "E_NO3j", "E_MP2.5i", "E_MP2.5j", "E_ORGi",  "E_ORGj", "E_ECi", "E_ECj", "H2O".


The speciation of emissions in VEIN can be done with three ways, by selecting the pollutants in ef_speed* functions, another way explicit and the other implicit.
The explicit way is by using the function `speciate` for the specifically available speciation. The implicit way is by adding a percentage value in the argument `k` in any of the functions of emission factors. The implicit way requires that the user must know the percentage of the species of pollutant.

## Speed functions of VOC species

As mentioned before, the speed function emission factors, currently cover several pollutants. We firstly focus on some PAH and POP. 

```{r}
library(vein)
pol <- c("indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene", "benzo(k)fluoranthene",
         "benzo(b)fluoranthene", "benzo(ghi)perylene", "fluoranthene",
         "benzo(a)pyrene")
df <- lapply(1:length(pol), function(i){
  EmissionFactors(ef_ldv_speed("PC", "4S", "<=1400", "G", "PRE",
                               pol[i], x = 10)(10))
})
names(df) <- pol
df
```

These pollutants come from -@NtziachristosSamaras2016 and in this case, are not dependent on speed. I used lapply to iterate in each pollutant at 10 km/h. Now I will show the same example for dioxins and furans.


```{r}
library(vein)
pol <- c("PCDD", "PCDF", "PCB")
df <- lapply(1:length(pol), function(i){
  EmissionFactors(ef_ldv_speed("PC", "4S", "<=1400", "G", "PRE",
                               pol[i], x = 10)(10))
})
names(df) <- pol
df
```




In the case of nmhc, the estimation is:


```{r}
library(vein)
pol <- c("ethane", "propane", "butane", "isobutane", "pentane")
df <- lapply(1:length(pol), function(i){
  EmissionFactors(ef_ldv_speed("PC", "4S", "<=1400", "G", "PRE",
                               pol[i], x = 10)(c(10,20,30)))
})
names(df) <- pol
df
```

Now the same example for one pollutant and several euro standards.


```{r}
library(vein)
euro <- c("V", "IV", "III", "II","I", "PRE")
df <- lapply(1:length(euro), function(i){
  EmissionFactors(ef_ldv_speed("PC", "4S", "<=1400", "G", euro[i],
                               "benzene")(c(10, 30, 50)))
})
names(df) <- euro
df
```


## Speciate function
The arguments of the function `speciate` are:

```{r}
args(vein::speciate)
```

Where,

- `x`: Emissions estimation
- `spec`: speciation: The speciations are: "bcom", tyre", "break", "road", "iag", "nox" and "nmhc". 'iag' now includes speciation for the use of industrial and building paintings. "bcom" stands for black carbon and organic matter.
- `veh`: Type of vehicle: When the spec is "bcom" or "nox" veh can be "PC", "LCV", HDV" or "Motorcycle". When spec is "iag" veh can take two values depending: when the speciation is for vehicles veh accepts "veh", eu "Evaporative", "Liquid" or "Exhaust" and fuel "G", "E" or "D", when the speciation is for painting, veh is "paint" fuel or eu can be "industrial" or "building" when spec is "nmhc", veh can be "LDV" with fuel "G" or "D" and eu "PRE", "I", "II", "III", "IV", "V", or "VI". when spec is "nmhc", veh can be "HDV" with fuel "D" and eu "PRE", "I", "II", "III", "IV", "V", or "VI". when spec is "nmhc" and fuel is "LPG", veh and eu must be "ALL"
- `fuel`: Fuel. When the spec is "bcom" fuel can be "G" or "D". When the spec is "iag" fuel can be "G", "E" or "D". When spec is "nox" fuel can be "G", "D", "LPG", "E85" or "CNG". Not required for "tyre", "break" or "road". When the spec is "nmhc" fuel can be G, D or LPG.
- `eu`: Euro emission standard: "PRE", "ECE_1501", "ECE_1502", "ECE_1503", "I", "II", "III", "IV", "V", "III-CDFP","IV-CDFP","V-CDFP", "III-ADFP", "IV-ADFP","V-ADFP" and "OPEN_LOOP". When the spec is "iag" accept the values "Exhaust" "Evaporative" and "Liquid". When the spec is "nox" eu can be "PRE", "I", "II", "III", "IV", "V", "VI", "VIc", "III-DPF" or "III+CRT". Not required for "tyre", "break" or "road"
- `show`: when TRUE shows the row of the table with respective speciation
- `list`: when TRUE returns a list with some elements of the list as the number species of pollutants

As shown before, there is currently 8 type of speciations. 

## Black carbon and organic matter

Let's use the data inside the vein and estimate emissions. The vehicles considered are Light Trucks, assuming all HGV. We are using
the 4 stage estimation with the first part arranging traffic data

```{r}
library(vein)
# 1 Traffic data
data(net)
data(profiles)
data(fe2015)
lt <- age_hdv(net$ldv)
vw <- temp_fact(net$ldv, profiles$PC_JUNE_2014) + 
  temp_fact(net$hdv, profiles$HGV_JUNE_2014)
speed <- netspeed(vw, net$ps, net$ffs, net$capacity, net$lkm, alpha = 1)
# 2 Emission factors
euro <- c("V", rep("IV", 3),  
          rep("III", 7), rep("II", 7), rep("I", 5), rep("PRE", 27))
lefd <- lapply(1:50, function(i) {
  ef_hdv_speed(v = "Trucks", t = "RT", g = ">32", gr = 0,
               eu = euro[i], l = 0.5, p = "PM",
               show.equation = FALSE) })
# 3 Estimate emissions
pmd <- emis(veh = lt, lkm = net$lkm, ef = lefd, speed = speed,
            profile = profiles$HGV_JUNE_2014)
# 4 process emissions
# Agreggating emissions by age of use
df <- apply(X = pmd, MARGIN = c(1,2), FUN = sum, na.rm = TRUE)
euro
dfbcom <-   rbind(speciate(df[, 1], "bcom", "PC", "D", "V"),
                  speciate(rowSums(df[, 2:4]), "bcom", "PC", "D", "IV"),
                  speciate(rowSums(df[, 5:11]), "bcom", "PC", "D", "III"),
                  speciate(rowSums(df[, 12:18]), "bcom", "PC", "D", "II"),
                  speciate(rowSums(df[, 19:23]), "bcom", "PC", "D", "I"),
                  speciate(rowSums(df[, 24:50]), "bcom", "PC", "D", "PRE"))
dfbcom$id <- 1:1505 
bc <- aggregate(dfbcom$BC, by = list(dfbcom$id), sum)
om <- aggregate(dfbcom$OM, by = list(dfbcom$id), sum)
net$BC <- bc[, 2]
net$OM <- om[, 2]
```


Now we have spatial objects of Back Carbon

```{r spplotbm, fig.cap="Black Carbon [g/168h]"}
sp::spplot(net, "BC", scales = list(draw = T), main = "Black Carbon [g/168h]",
           col.regions = rev(cptcity::cpt()))
```

moreover, Organic Matter

```{r spplotom, fig.cap = "Organic Matter [g/168h]"}
sp::spplot(net, "OM", scales = list(draw = T), main = "Organic Matter [g/168h]",
           col.regions = rev(cptcity::cpt()))
```

If you are interested in speciate total emissions by age of use not spatial emissions, you could use `emis_post` with `by = "veh"` and then aggregate the emissions by standard. Then speciate PM by standard:

```{r}
dfpm <- emis_post(arra = pmd,  veh = "LT", size = "small", fuel = "D",
                  pollutant = "PM", by = "veh")
dfpm$euro <- euro
dfpmeuro <- aggregate(dfpm$g, by = list(dfpm$euro), sum)
names(dfpmeuro) <- c("euro", "g")
bcom <- as.data.frame(sapply(1:6, function(i){
  speciate(dfpmeuro$g[i], "bcom", "PC", "D", dfpmeuro$euro[i])
}))
names(bcom) <- dfpmeuro$euro
```
And the resulting speciation is:

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(bcom, caption = "Black Carbon and Organic Matter [g/168h]", digits = 2)
```


## Tyre wear, breaks wear and road abrasion

Tire, break and road abrasions come from -@NtziachristosBoulter2009. Tires consist of a complex mixture of rubber, which after the user starts to degrade. Indeed, when the driving cycle is more aggressive, higher is tire mass emitted from the tire, with tire wear emission factors higher in HDV than LDV. Break wear emits mass and with more aggressive driving, more emissions. 

The input are wear emissions in Total Suspended Particles (TSP) ,as explained in section \@ref(#ew). The speciation consists in 60% PM10, 42% PM2.5, 6% PM1 and 4.8% PM0.1. Now, a simple example for TP adspeciation:


```{r}
library(vein)
data(net)
data(profiles)
pro <- profiles$PC_JUNE_2012[, 1] # 24 hours
pc_week <- temp_fact(net$ldv+net$hdv, pro)
df <- netspeed(pc_week, net$ps, net$ffs, net$capacity, net$lkm, alpha = 1)
ef <- ef_wear(wear = "tyre", type = "PC", speed = df)
emit <- emis_wear(veh = age_ldv(net$ldv, name = "VEH"), speed = df,
                  lkm = net$lkm, ef = ef, profile =  pro)
emib <- emis_wear(what = "break", veh = age_ldv(net$ldv, name = "VEH"),
                  lkm = net$lkm, ef = ef, profile =  pro, speed = df)
emit
emib
emitp <- emis_post(arra = emit, veh = "PC", size = "ALL", fuel = "G",
                   pollutant = "TSP", by = "veh")
emibp <- emis_post(arra = emib, veh = "PC", size = "ALL", fuel = "G",
                   pollutant = "TSP", by = "veh")
```

The estimation covered 24 hours and for simplicity, we are assuming
a year with 365 similar days and dividing by 1 million to have t/y. Hence,the
speciation is:

```{r styre, fig.cap="Break and Tyre emissions (t/y)"}
library(ggplot2)
tyrew <- speciate(x =  unclass(emitp$g), spec = "tyre")
breakw <- speciate(x =  unclass(emibp$g), spec = "brake")
df <- data.frame(Emis = c(sapply(tyrew, sum), sapply(breakw, sum))*365/1000000)
df$Pollutant <- factor(x = names(tyrew), levels = names(tyrew))
df$Emissions <- c(rep("Tyre", 4), rep("Brake", 4))
ggplot(df, aes(x = Pollutant, y = Emis, fill = Emissions)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge")+
  labs(x = NULL, y = "[t/y]")
```

It is interesting to see that break emissions are higher than tire wear emissions, and the smaller the diameter, higher the difference, as shown:

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(sapply(breakw, sum) / sapply(tyrew, sum),
             caption = "Ratio between break and tire wear emissions")
```

The procedure can be used with `emis_post` with `by  = streets_wide` to obtain the spatial speciation.

## $NO$ and $NO_2$

The speciation of $NO_X$ into $NO$ and $NO2$ depends on the type of vehicle, fuel, and euro standard. The following example will consist in comparing a Gasoline passenger car and a Diesel truck.

```{r}
library(vein)
data(net)
data(profiles)
propc <- profiles$PC_JUNE_2012[, 1] # 24 hours
prolt <- profiles$PC_JUNE_2012[, 1] # 24 hours
pweek <- temp_fact(net$ldv+net$hdv, pro)
df <- netspeed(pc_week, net$ps, net$ffs, net$capacity, net$lkm, alpha = 1)
euro <- c("V", rep("IV", 3),  
          rep("III", 7), rep("II", 7), rep("I", 5), rep("PRE", 27))
lefpc <- lapply(1:50, function(i) {
  ef_ldv_speed(v = "PC", t = "4S", cc = "<=1400", f = "G",
               eu = euro[i], p = "NOx", show.equation = FALSE) })
leflt <- lapply(1:50, function(i) {
  ef_hdv_speed(v = "Trucks", t = "RT", g = ">32", gr = 0,
               eu = euro[i], l = 0.5, p = "NOx", show.equation = FALSE) })
emipc <- emis(veh = age_ldv(net$ldv),lkm = net$lkm, ef = lefpc, speed = df,
              profile = profiles$PC_JUNE_2014[, 1])*365/1000000
emilt <- emis(veh = age_ldv(net$hdv),lkm = net$lkm, ef = leflt, speed = df,
              profile = profiles$HGV_JUNE_2014[, 1])*365/1000000
```

Then, once the emissions are estimated, we will speciate the emissions by euro standard. The estimation covered 24 hours, and for simplicity, we are assuming a year with 365 similar days and dividing by 1 million to have t/y.

```{r sno2}
df <- rowSums(apply(X = emipc, MARGIN = c(2,3), FUN = sum, na.rm = TRUE))
dfpc <-   rbind(speciate(df[1], "nox", "PC", "G", "V"),
                speciate(df[2:4], "nox", "PC", "G", "V"),
                speciate(df[5:11], "nox", "PC", "G", "V"),
                speciate(df[12:18], "nox", "PC", "G", "V"),
                speciate(df[19:23], "nox", "PC", "G", "V"),
                speciate(df[24:50], "nox", "PC", "G", "V"))
df <- rowSums(apply(X = emipc, MARGIN = c(2,3), FUN = sum, na.rm = TRUE))
dfhdv <-   rbind(speciate(df[1], "nox", "HDV", "D", "V"),
                 speciate(df[2:4], "nox", "HDV", "D", "V"),
                 speciate(df[5:11], "nox", "HDV", "D", "V"),
                 speciate(df[12:18], "nox", "HDV", "D", "V"),
                 speciate(df[19:23], "nox", "HDV", "D", "V"),
                 speciate(df[24:50], "nox", "HDV", "D", "V"))

df <- data.frame(rbind(sapply(dfpc, sum), sapply(dfhdv, sum)))
row.names(df) <- c("PC", "HGV")
knitr::kable(df, caption = "NO2 and NO speciation (t/y)")
```

## Volatile organic compounds: `nmhc`

nmhc was shown earlier in this chapter, but they can also be used to speciate objects, resulting in all species at once. The speciation of NMHC must be applied to NMHC. However, the emission guidelines of 
-@NtziachristosSamaras2016 does not show specific emission factor of NMHC and the suggested procedure is subtract the $CH_4$ from the $HC$. I included this aspect in VEIN with ef_speed* functions to return NMHC directly.


```{r}
library(vein)
data(net)
data(profiles)
propc <- profiles$PC_JUNE_2012[, 1] # 24 hours
pweek <- temp_fact(net$ldv+net$hdv, propc)
df <- netspeed(pweek, net$ps, net$ffs, net$capacity, net$lkm, alpha = 1)
euro <- c("V", rep("IV", 3),  
          rep("III", 7), rep("II", 7), rep("I", 5), rep("PRE", 27))
lefpc <- lapply(1:50, function(i) {
  ef_ldv_speed(v = "PC", t = "4S", cc = "<=1400", f = "G",
               eu = euro[i], p = "NMHC", show.equation = FALSE)})
```





```{r}
euro <- c("V", rep("IV", 3),  
          rep("III", 7), rep("II", 7), rep("I", 5), rep("PRE", 27))
lefpc <- lapply(1:length(euro), function(i) {
  ef_ldv_speed(v = "PC", t = "4S", cc = "<=1400", f = "G",
               eu = euro[i], p = "HC", show.equation = FALSE) })
enmhc <- emis(veh = age_ldv(net$ldv), lkm = net$lkm, ef = lefpc, speed = df,
              profile = profiles$PC_JUNE_2014[, 1])

df_enmhc <- emis_post(arra = enmhc, veh = "PC", size = "ALL", fuel = "G",
                      pollutant = "NMHC", by = "veh")
# assuming all euro I
spec <- speciate(x = as.numeric(df_enmhc$g), spec = "nmhc", veh = "LDV",
                 fuel = "G", eu = "I")
names(spec)
```


## The speciation `iag`

The Carbon Bond Mechanism Z [-@cbmz] is a lumped-structure mechanism.

Citing:

**"it is currently unfeasible to treat the organic species individually in a regional or global chemistry model for three primary reasons:**

**- (1) limited computational resources,**
**- (2) lack of detailed speciated emissions inventories, and **
**- (3) lack of kinetic and mechanistic information for all the species and their reaction products.**

**Thus there exists a need for a condensed mechanism that is capable of describing the tropospheric hydrocarbon chemistry with reasonable accuracy, sensitivity, and speed at regional to global scales. **


The research in this aspect is intense and out of the scope of this book.  However, it is vital that the user who intends to performs an atmospheric simulation to understand this why it is essential to speciate the emissions
and what represent each group. 

A popular air quality model nowadays is the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled to Chemistry (WRF-Chem) [@Grelletal2005] https://ruc.noaa.gov/wrf/wrf-chem/and the **Emissions Guide** (https://ruc.noaa.gov/wrf/wrf-chem/Emission_guide.pdf).


The speciation `iag` splits the NMHC into the lumped groups for the mechanism CMB-Z. The name `iag` comes from the Institute of Astronomy, Geophysics and Atmospheric Sciences (IAG, http://www.iag.usp.br/) from the University of São Paulo (USP). The Department of Atmospheric Sciences (DAC) of IAG has measure and model air quality models for several years. There are several scientific productions such as:
-@Nogueiraetal2015, -@HOSHYARIPOUR2016365, -@Andradeetal2017, 
-@Freitasetal2005, -@martins2006emission, -@perez2014emission,
-@ulke2001modeling, -@vivanco2006validation, -@boian2012characterization,
-@Andrade2012, -@Andradeetal2015, -@VaraVelaetal2015, -@Rafee2015,
-@Ibarraetal2017b. The following figure shows an air quality simulation over South East Brazil from DAC/IAG/USP.

```{r echo= FALSE, fig.cap="http://www.lapat.iag.usp.br/aerossol/wrf9/index.php"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figuras/wrf.png")
```

Some of these papers show measurements in tunnels and fuel. The speciation `iag` it is based on these experiments, and the last versions, covers an update during 2015 so that the exhaust emissions speciation is more representative of Brazilian gasoline, which means?

- ** THE SPECIATION `IAG` IS BASED ON BRAZILIAN MEASUREMENTS**.

Moreover, the user who wants to apply it outside Brazil should be ensured, that the fleet and fuel are compatible. As that will be hard to accomplish, I can say that this speciation is for and to be used in Brazil, even more, in São Paulo.

The currently speciation `iag` is:

```{r echo= FALSE, fig.cap="Speciation for NMHC by type of fuel and process mol/100g (Ibarra-Espinosa, S., 2017)"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figuras/iag1.png")
```


The arguments of the function `speciate` take the following form:

- `x`: Emissions estimation, it is recommended that x are griddded emissions from NMHC.
- `spec`: `iag`. Alternatively, you can put any name of the following:
"e_eth", "e_hc3", "e_hc5", "e_hc8", "e_ol2", "e_olt", "e_oli", "e_iso", 
"e_tol", "e_xyl", "e_c2h5oh", "e_hcho", "e_ch3oh", "e_ket"
- `veh`: When spec is "iag" veh can take two values depending: when the
speciation is for vehicles veh accepts "veh", eu "Evaporative", "Liquid" or
"Exhaust"
- `fuel`:  "G", "E" or "D".
- `eu`: "Exhaust" "Evaporative" or "Liquid". 
- `show`: Let this FALSE.
- `list`: Let this TRUE so that the result is a list, and each element of the
list a /lumped specie.

Example:

```{r}
# Do not run
x <- data.frame(x = rnorm(n = 100, mean = 400, sd = 2))
dfa <- speciate(x, spec = "e_eth", veh = "veh", fuel = "G", eu = "Exhaust")
head(dfa)
df <- speciate(x, spec = "iag", veh = "veh", fuel = "G",
               eu = "Exhaust", list = TRUE)
names(df)
for(i in 1:length(df)){
  print(df[[i]][1:3, ]) # Firt three lines of each element of the list
}
```


## The speciation `pmiag`

The speciation `pmiag`is also based on IAG studies and applied only for PM2.5 emissions. The speciation splits the PM2.5 in percentages  as follow:

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(x = data.frame(E_SO4i = 0.0077, E_SO4j = 0.0623, E_NO3i = 0.00247,
                            E_NO3j = 0.01053, E_MP2.5i = 0.1, E_MP2.5j = 0.3, 
                            E_ORGi = 0.0304, E_ORGj = 0.1296, E_ECi = 0.056,

```

When running this speciation, the only two required arguments are `x` and
`spec`. Also, There is a message that this speciation applies **only
in gridded emissions, because the unit must be in flux $g/km^2/h$**, and
internally are transformed to the required unit $ \mu g/m^2/s$ as:

$$ \frac{g}{(km)^2*h}*\frac{10^6 \mu g}{g}*(\frac{km}{1000m})^2*\frac{h}{3600s}\frac{1}{dx^2}$$

dx is the length of the grid cell.
Example:
```{r}
library(vein)
data(net)
pm <- data.frame(pm = rnorm(n = length(net), mean = 400, sd = 2))
net@data <- pm
g <- make_grid(net, 1/102.47/2) # 500 m
gx <- emis_grid(net, g)
df <- speciate(gx, spec = "pmiag", veh = "veh", fuel = "G",
               eu = "Exhaust", list = FALSE, dx = 0.5)
names(df)
head(df)
```
