# Quality check and errors {#check}

## Back to basics

## Traffic flow

## Vehicular composition

The vehicular composition is a critical part in the emissions inventories for
vehicles. It consists in the oercetnage of each type of vehicle and technology.
Despite that it seems pretty straightforward, making a mistake in this part
of the emissions inventories would have catastrophic time cost. **Developing an**
**emissions inventory is a triccy task, you must take great care in simple**
**calculations, because if the resutls are not consistent, it can take LOTS**
**of time, to find the error, usually when the dealines are dead**.

A few days ago, I was developing an inventory in which my team was evaluating
the impact in air quality of a new type of fuel on the city of SÃ£o Paulo. The
results were consistens comparison base case with scenario, however, the magnitud 
of the emissions are too high. The air quality simulatiosn showed a clear 
bias, constant over time. I struggled to find any error without results.
Until I remembered the words of my former boss _Plot the results, becaust it is_
_easier fo find any mistake_. I did it, and this is was the result.
