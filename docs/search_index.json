This process is complex and can be dificult. It is required a big amount of information related to traffic, emissions factors and then process the outpus for the desired purpose. In this book this process is addressed with the VEIN (Ibarra-Espinosa et al. 2018) model, which is an R package available at https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=vein}. Purpose I wrote this book to provide instructions to all possible users who want to estimate vehicular emissions using VEIN. VEIN provides several function which are related to each other reading different traffic sources and emission factors for different pollutants. However, incorporating all the functions with input/output (I/O) process can be difficult. Moreover, communicating the recommended practices and instructions to a increasingly broader audience can be more difficult. Therefore, the purpose of this book is to reach the maximum amount of interested people in a simple way. The language chosen is engligh because it is the global language. Structure Chapter 1 covers the introduction to this book including the installation of R packages and dependent libraries to several operative systems. Chapter 2 covers basics commands using R. Chapter 3 presents the function inventory to produce an structure of directories and scripts for runnin vein. Chapter 4 covers the required traffic data for inputting into VEIN including differenttypes and sources of information. Chapter 5 includes the emission factors that are included into the package and also, examples for inputing and creating new emission factors. Chapter 6 presents the estimations functions and tips. Chapter 7 includes the functions to do post-estimations to generate emission data-bases and also emissions at each street. Chapter 8 and 9 provides applications into air quality modeling, some studies with to investigte health effects and lastly, the use of VEIN as a tool for environmental planning. About the author Sergio Ibarra Espinosa is a chilean Environmental and Loss Prevention Engineer from the Technologycal Metropolitan University (UTEM) where study the health effects of air pollution using R in year 2007. Then started working at the National Center for Environment (CENMA) in Chile focused on emissions from vehicles, airports, biomass burning and minning industry. Then obtained a MSc. in Environmental Planning and Managment from the University of Chile, with a scholarship form CENMA. Then obtained a PhD. in Meteorology at the Institute of Astronomy, Geophysics and Atmospheric Sciences (IAG) from the University of SÃ£o Paulo (USP) with scholarship from CAPEs during the first year and Becas Chile for the last three years. During his PhD. he learned programming with R and developed the R package VEIN. References "]
