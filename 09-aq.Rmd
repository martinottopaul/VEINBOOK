# Inputs for atmospheric models with `eixport` Package {#ep}

This last chapter of this book is about generating inputs for atmospheric
models, specifically, **WRF-Chem** [@Grelletal2005]. As the Pacific Northwest 
National Laboratory (PNNL, https://www.pnnl.gov/atmospheric/research/wrf-chem/)
defines:


**The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model is a next generation **
**meteorological model being developed collaboratively among several agencies**
**(NOAA/NCEP, NOAA/ESRL, NCAR). WRF-Chem is a version of WRF that also**
**simultaneously simulates the emission, turbulent mixing, transport,**
**transformation, and fate of trace gases and aerosols.**

Initially, VEIN counted with the function `emis_wrf` which created a data.frame
object of hourly gridded emissions with each pollutant as a column, from the
first cell to the last. The data-frame extendend in long format to each hour.
This data.frame was designed to be used with script Another Asimilation
System for WRF (AS4WRF) [@VaraVelaetal2015] written in NCL [@ncl]. 

This approach was effective and already tested for some Latinamerican cities
[@micro], [@icshmo]. However, this function depends on external software which
may not be available. Therefore, me andsome collegues developed the package
`eixport` [@eixport], [@eixport2], which is an R package to read and export
emissions to atmospheric models. `eixport` currently covers the models
WRF-Chem [@Grelletal2005], SPM-BRAMS [@Freitasetal2005] and R-LINE [@rline], but
only the WRF-Chem interface has been fully implemented. Therefore, this chapter
covers only this model.

The concept of connecting VEIN and Wrf-Chem via eixport is quite simple with
two approaches:

1. Generating `GriddedEmissionsArray` for the wrfinput grid and inputting this
emissions into the wrfchemi input file..
2. Generating gridded emissions data-frame for AS4WRF.

## WRFChem input with wrfinput and `GriddedEmissionsArray`

```{r , eval = FALSE, include = FALSE}
library(DiagrammeR)

p1 <- grViz("digraph boxes_and_circles {
      graph [overlap = false,

            fixedsize = false,
            fillcolor = green,
            color = black,
            fontcolor = black,
            fontize = 12]
      wrf_create;
      wrf_put;

      edge [color = black,
            arrowhead = vee,
            penwidth = 1.5]
      wrfinput_d0x -> {make_grid wrf_create}
      EmissionsArray -> emis_post
      emis_post -> emis_merge
      {make_grid emis_merge} -> {emis_grid}
      emis_grid -> GriddedEmissionsArray
      GriddedEmissionsArray -> wrf_put
      {wrf_put wrf_create} -> wrfcheminput
      }
      ")
```

The process for generation WRF-Chem input files with `GriddedEmissionsArray` is
shown on Fig. \@ref(fig:gea). Pink boxes are classes, grey boxes are `vein`
functions, green functions are  `eixport` functions and white boxes, external
objects. Here, the external input file is the **wrfinputd_0x**
file, where the **x** is for the domain. This file is inputted into the function
`make_grid` which creates a polygon grid needed by `emis_grid`. The main
characteristic of this grid, is that it has the resolution of the wrfinput
file.

The wrfinpiut_d0x file isalso used by the `eixport` function `wrf_create` to
create a wrfchemi input file with zeroes.

The objects with class `EmissionsArray` for each type of vehicle and pollutant are 
processed by the function `emis_post` which create street emissions. Then, the function
`emis_merge` merges all the street emissions files from `emis_post_ into one
street emissions by pollutant ehich is inputted into function `emis_grid` to
create a polygon grid of emissions, class Spatial Feature `sf` [@sf], [@RJ-2018-009].
Then, the spatial gridded emissions are inputted into the contructor function
`GriddedEmissionsArray` to create an object of that class, and the dimensions
of the wrfinput file, that is, the sanem number of spatial rows and columns.

Finally, the `GriddedEmissionsArray` objects are inputted into the wrfchemi
file with the `eixport` function `wrf_put`.

Example

### Creating a WRF-Chem input file

The emission file will be generated with traffic simulation from the 
Traffic Engineering Company (CET) for 2012, which consists
in traffic flow for morning rush hour of Light Duty Vehicles (LDV) and
Heavy Good Vehicles (HGV). The emission factors will be the data `fe2015`
and the wrfinput comes from the `eixport` package. Let's go:

#### 0) Network

The object net has a class `SpatialLinesDataFrame`, we transform it into a
`sf`object. The length of the road is the field 'lkm' in the object net, which
are in km but has no units. We must add the right units in order to use `vein`

```{r}
require(vein)
require(sf)
require(units)
net <- readRDS("figuras/net.rds")
class(net)
net <- st_as_sf(net)
net[1, ]
net$lkm <- set_units(st_length(net), km) # ensure right units
```


#### 1) Vehicular composition

In this case, the vehicular composition consits in only to vehicles, Passenger
Cars using Gasoline with 25\% of Ethanol and Light Trucks consuming Diesel with 
5\% od biodiesel. Also, the emission factors cover $CO$. The
temporal distribution will cover only one hour.

```{r}
PC_E25 <- age_ldv(net$ldv)
LT_B5 <- age_hdv(net$hdv)
```

#### 2) Emission factors

The emission factors used comes from -@CETESB2015, which are constant by age of use.
In practice, this data.frame is like an Excel spreadsheet. Then, the constructor
function `EmissionFactorsList` convert our numeric vector, which is the column
of our data.frame, into required type of object of the `emis` function. Parenthesis
were added in order to print the objects in one line.

```{r}
data(fe2015)
(EF_CO_PC_E25 <- EmissionFactorsList(fe2015[fe2015$Pollutant == "CO", "PC_G"]))
(EF_CO_LT_B5 <- EmissionFactorsList(fe2015[fe2015$Pollutant == "CO", "LT"]))
```
#### 3) Estimation of emissions

The estimation of emissions is shown in the following code chunk in a simplified
way. The emissions array are aggregated.

```{r}
data(profiles)
emi1 <- emis(veh = PC_E25, lkm = net$lkm, ef = EF_CO_PC_E25,
             profile = profiles$PC_JUNE_2012)
emi2 <- emis(veh = LT_B5, lkm = net$lkm, ef = EF_CO_PC_E25,
             profile = profiles$HGV_JUNE_2012)
emi = emi1 + emi2
```

#### 4) Post-estimations

The resulting emissions array `emi` is now processed with `emis_post`.

```{r}
co_street <- emis_post(arra = emi, by = "streets_wide", net = net)
```


#####  4a WRFChem input file with `eixport`

Now it is time generate the emissions grid. In order to create a wrfchem input
file, we need a wrfinput file. In this case, the wrfinput coversa wider area
of the emissions, located in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. The wrfinput file is available
from the R package `eixport`.

```{r}
wrf <- paste(system.file("extdata", package = "eixport"),
             "/wrfinput_d02", sep="")
g  <- make_grid(wrf)
plot(st_geometry(g), axes = TRUE)
plot(st_geometry(co_street), add = TRUE)
```

Notice that weh we create grid from the path to wrfinput, there is a message
with *Number of lat points 51* and *Number of lon points 63*. This information
is crytical for later conversions. Now that we have the street emissions and the
grid, we can obtain our gridded emissions:

```{r}
gCO <- emis_grid(spobj = co_street, g = g)
names(gCO)
gCO$geometry
```

This function requires the package `lwgeom` when the data is in latitude and
longitude degrees. There are some messages about the total emissions of 
street and grid. This was made in order to ensure that emis_grid is conservative.
The resulting object `gCO` is an `sf` object of POLYGON. In order to plot the
emissions, i selected the emissions above 1, because it is easier to see the 
plot. If we plot the gridded emissions, we will see:


```{r GEmi, fig.cap="Gridded emissions (mol/h)"}
gCO$V9 <- gCO$V9*(12 + 16)^-1
plot(gCO[gCO$V9 >1, "V9"], axes = TRUE,  nbreaks = 50,
     pal = cptcity::cpt(colorRampPalette = T),
     main = "Emissions of CO at 08:00 (mol/h)")
```

The emissions are mostly distributed into main roads, as expected. The next step
is create the `GriddedEmissionsArray` that will be inputted into the `eixport`
functions. The `GriddedEmissionsArray` is a contructor function that reads
class, `SpatialPolygonDataFrame`, `sf` of POLYGONs, a `data.frame` or a `matrix`
to create an Array of the gridded emissions. The dimensions are lat, lon, mass
and time. Therefore, it is important to know the number of lat and lon points!

```{r GEA, fig.cap="GriddedEmissionsArray (mol/h)"}
gCOA <- GriddedEmissionsArray(x = gCO, cols = 63, rows = 51, times = 168)
plot(gCOA, col = cptcity::cpt())
```

The image is similar to the plot of the gridded emissions, which means that it
is correct. Now we can input the our new created object `gCOA` into the wrfchem
input file, but first, we need to create it. This is done using the `eixport`
functions.

We first load the library `eixport`. Then load the data `emis_opt` which has the
emissions options for WRFchem. In this case, we are creating an wrfchem input
file with 40 pollutants, with 0.

```{r}
library(eixport)
data(emis_opt)
emis_opt[["ecb05_opt1"]]
wrf_create(wrfinput_dir = system.file("extdata", package = "eixport"),
           wrfchemi_dir = tempdir(),
           frames_per_auxinput5 = 168,
           domains = 2,
           variaveis = emis_opt[["ecb05_opt1"]],
           verbose = F)

```

The wrfchemi input file was created on a temporal directory with the function
`tempdir`. Now we can input our `GriddedEmissionsArray` into our new
wrfchem input file.

```{r}
f <- list.files(path = tempdir(), full.names = T, pattern = "wrfchemi_d02")
f
wrf_put(file = f, name = "E_CO", POL = gCOA)
```

Then, we just check our resulting NetCDF file plotting the emissions we just put.

```{r Fwrf, eval = FALSE}
wrf_plot(f, "E_CO")
```

```{r wrf,  echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Wrfchem input file (NetCDF) (mol/h)", out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figuras/wrf2.png")

```

##### 4b WRFChem input file with `emis_wrf`

`emis_wrf` creates a `data.frame` with columns lat, long, id, pollutants, local time 
and GMT time. This dataframe has the proper format to be used with WRF assimilation 
system: "ASimilation System 4 WRF (AS4WRF, -@angel)

```{r}
args(emis_wrf)
```


where:

- `sdf`: Gridded emissions, which can be a SpatialPolygonsDataFrame, or a list of 
SpatialPolygonsDataFrame, or a sf object of "POLYGON". The user must enter a list with
36 SpatialPolygonsDataFrame with emissions for the mechanism CBM-Z.
- `nr`: Number of repetitions of the emissions period
- `dmyhm`: String indicating Day Month Year Hour and Minute in the format "d-m-Y H:M" 
e.g.: "01-05-2014 00:00" It represents the time of the first hour of emissions in 
Local Time
- `tz`: Time zone as required in for function as.POSIXct
- `crs`: Coordinate reference system, e.g: "+init=epsg:4326". Used to transform the coordinates of the output
- `islist`: logical value to indicate if sdf is a list or not
- `utc`: ignored.

In this case, we can use our gridded emissions directly here:

```{r}
gCO$id <- NULL
df <- emis_wrf(sdf = gCO, dmyhm = "06-10-2014 00:00",
               tz = "America/Sao_Paulo", islist = FALSE)
head(df)
```

Then you must export this `data.frame` into a .txt file. You must include
the number of columns to match your luped species and also take out the columns
time_lt, time_utc and dutch. These three columns are just informative.

```{r}
df <- df[,1:4]
write.table(x = df, file = tempfile(), sep = "\t",
            col.names = TRUE, row.names = FALSE)
```

Finally, in order to generate the wrfchem input file, you must have the 
resulting .txt file, a wrfinput file with the same grid spacing, the NCL
script AS4WRF and a namelist. AS4WRF and the namelist can be obtained contacting
angel.vela@iag.usp.br and alvv1986@gmail.com.
