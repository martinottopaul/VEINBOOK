# Emission Factors {#ef}

An emission factor is the amount of mass of pollutant generated by activities
[@pulles2010art]. In the case of vehicles, the emission factors are generally
known as the mass of pollutant per traveled distance $g \cdot km^{-1}$ in metric
units. The distance unit could be different, like miles for instance. 
The type of units depends on measurement used when developing the emission factors.

There are hot and cold exhaust emisions. _Hot_ exhaust emissions are produced by a 
vehicle when its engine and exhaust after-treatment system are at their normal
operational temperatures and _Cold_ during the vehicle warm-up phase [@trlef].

The emission factors comes from measurement of pollutants emitted by the sources.
In the case of vehicles, the dynanometer measurements the emission factors are
the mass of pollutant collected during the distance traveled by a vehicle 
following a specific driving cycle. The Federal Test Procedure (FTP) is a test
to certify the vehicle emissions under the driving cycles such as FTP-75. This
driving cycle has a duration of 1874 $s$ for a distance of 17783 $m$ and average
speed of 34.12 $km \cdot h^{-1}$ [@tim].

In the literature it is possible to find different type of emission factors. For
instance, in europe, during the development of the project Assesment of 
Reliability of Transport Emission Models and Inventory Systems (ARTEMIS), it was
developed the *traffic situation model*. This concept consists in the 
combination of parameters that affects the vehicle kinematics and engine 
operation: type of road, sinuosity and gradient, trafffic conditions or level
of service (free-flow, heavy, saturated and stop and go) and average speed by
speed limit of the road [@artemis]. Measurenets of vehicular emissions under 
each traffic situation led to emission factors by traffic situation, used in the
Handbook of Emission Factors (HBEFA, www.hbefa.net).

There is another approach based on 1 Hz measurement of emissions. Here, the
pollutants are measured on real live traffic driving. Emission factors can be
derived here using mainly two approaches. One approach is applying the Vehicular
Specific Power (VSP) [@jimenez1999vehicle]. This methods is used in the MOtor 
Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES) [@koupal2003design] and the International
Vehicle Emissions model (IVE) [@Davisetal2005]. Another approach is to apply 
the Passenger car and Heavy-duty Emission Model (PHEM), which is based on
instantaneous engine power demand and engine speed developed during the Artemis 
project [@tim, @artemis].

Perhaps the most used approach to obtain emission factors are the speed 
functions. As the emissions tests on driving cycles are valid for only one
average speed, measuring emissions of different driving cycles at different
average speeds, allow to obtain point clouds where a regressions is applied,
obtaining an emission factor as a speed function. The literature shows
experiments in diffferent parts of the world, such as in Chile 
[@Corvalanetal2002] and Europe [@ntziachristos2000speed]. However, probably
the most used source of emission factors as speed functions are the European 
emission guidelines developed by the European Monitoring and Evaluation
Programme (EMEP, http://www.emep.int/) and published by the European
Environment Agency (EEA, https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/air/emep-eea-air-pollutant-emission-inventory-guidebook/emep) [@NtziachristosSamaras2016]. These emission factors are included
in the VEIN model.

Another aspect important in vehicular emissions is the degradation of the
emissions of aged vehicles. Over the time, different part of the vehicles suffer
deterioration, increasing the emissions. Therefore, approachas have been 
developed to account of this effect in inventories. One approach consists in
determining functions that increment the emissions by accumulated mileage, such
as studies of -@CorvalanVargas2003.

In Brazil, the emission factors are reported by the Environmental Protection 
Agency of São Paulo -@CETESB2015, in their vehicular emissions inventory report.
Light vehicles emission factors comes from average measurements of the FTP75 
driving cycle, motorcycle emission factors comes from average measurements of 
World Motorcycle Test Cycle (WMTC) and HDV with from the European Stationary 
Cycle (ETC).

As the VEIN model was developed in Brazil, but user of other parts of the world
may be intereted in using the model, the approach in VEIN has to allow
flexibility to the user. Therefore, the emission factors approach in VEIN 
consists in three options, as shown on Fig. (\@ref(fig:diaef)). The first approach
consists in local emissions factors by age of use, such as the one from 
-@CETESB2015, denoted as local_ef in the green circle. The second approach
consists in selecting speed functions from -@NtziachristosSamaras2016, availabe 
in VEIN and denoted as the grey box as speed_ef. The third approach conists in
incorporate speed variation from the speed function into the local emission
factors by age of use. In any case, VEIN count with function to account of the
degradation of emissions due to accumulated mileage denotes in grey box as
emis_det. These emissions are entered into the estimation emission function.

The following sections show how to do these calculation in VEIN, step by step.

## Speed functions `ef_ldv_speed` and `ef_hdv_speed` {#speedef} 

The estimation of emissions in VEIn is shown the equation \@ref(eq:emi):

\begin{equation}
EH_{i,j,k,l,m} =F_{i,j,k,l} \cdot L_i \cdot EF(V_{i,l})_{j,k,m} \cdot DF_{j,k}
(\#eq:emi)
\end{equation}

Where  $EH_{i,j,k,l,m}$ is the emissions for each street link $i$, vehicle category
from composition $k$, hour $l$ and pollutant $m$, where $F_{i,j,k,l}$ is the
vehicular flow calculated in Eq. 1. $L_i$ is the length of the street link $i$.
$EF(V_{i,l})_{j,k,m}$ is the emission factor of each pollutant $m$. $DF_{j,k}$ is
the deterioration factor for vehicle of type $j$ and age of use $k$, explained
in detial in section \@ref(det).


These function return speed functions as $f(V)$. The functions comes from the 
EMEP/EEA emissions guidelines [@NtziachristosSamaras2016] and are available
in PDF reports. The equations and their parameter were translated to 
spreedsheets and loaded internally in VEIN. Therefore, the user only must
enter the required parameters obtaining the desired function. The functions
respect the assumptions and speed limits.

### Emission factors of LDV depending on  speed with the function `ef_ldv_speed`

The arguments for `ef_ldv_speed` are:

- `v`: Category vehicle: "PC", "LCV", "Motorcycle" or "Moped".
- `t`: Sub-category of of vehicle: PC: "ECE_1501", "ECE_1502", "ECE_1503", 
"ECE_1504" , "IMPROVED_CONVENTIONAL", "OPEN_LOOP", "ALL", "2S" or "4S". LCV: "4S", 
Motorcycle: "2S" or "4S". Moped: "2S" or "4S".
- `cc`: Size of engine in cc: PC: "<=1400", ">1400", "1400_2000", ">2000", "<=800",
"<=2000". Motorcycle: ">=50" (for "2S"), "<=250", "250_750", ">=750". Moped: 
"<=50". LCV : "<3.5" for gross weight.
- `f`: Type of fuel: "G", "D", "LPG" or "FH" (Full Hybrid: starts by electric 
motor).
- `eu`: Euro standard: "PRE", "I", "II", "III", "III+DPF", "IV", "V", "VI" or 
"VIc".
- `p`: Pollutant: "CO", "FC", "NOx", "HC" or "PM".
- `k`: Multiplication factor.
- `show.equation`: Option to see or not the equation parameters.

It is very important that the user enter the right value into the arguments
because the final category must match. If the user enters values that do not
match, the resulting speed function will be wrong. There are 146 matchs. The
probably most used combinations are:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
df <- read.csv("figuras/matchs.csv")
df <- df[df$v %in% c("PC", "LCV", "Motorcycle") &
           df$t == "4S", ]
df <- data.frame(
  Argument  = c("v", "t", "cc", "f", "eu", "p"),
  Value = c("PC LCV Motorcycles",
            "4S",
            "<=1400 1400_2000 >2000",
            "G D",
            "PRE I II III IV V VI",
            "CO NOx HC FC PM"))
knitr::kable(df,
             caption = 'Most used combinations for emission factors for LDV',
             booktabs = TRUE
)
```

The returning speed function represents how a type of vehicle emits pollutants
on average. Fig. (\@ref(fig:figef)) shows the emissions of CO by Passenger 
Cars with with technologies Pre Euro and Euro I from -@NtziachristosSamaras2016.
Higher emissions occure at low average speeds and older vehicles with
technologies pre Euro emit more than vehicles with Euro I. Even more, the 
average emissions of Pre Euro are 29.31 $g \cdot km^{-1}$ and Euro I 2.61
$g \cdot km^{-1}$, meaning that, on average, a vehicle Pre euro is 14 times than
a vehicle with euro I. 

The Fig. (\@ref(fig:figef)) shows the plot using the package ggplot2 [@ggplot2]. This package requires that the data must be in long format. 

```{r figef, fig.cap='Emission factor as a speed function', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}

ef1 <- ef_ldv_speed(v = "PC", cc = "<=1400", f = "G",
                    eu = "PRE", p = "CO", show.equation = F)
ef2 <- ef_ldv_speed(v = "PC", cc = "<=1400", f = "G",
                    eu = "I", p = "CO", show.equation = F)
V <- 0:110
df <- data.frame(EF = c(ef1(V), ef2(V)))
df$V = V
df$Euro <- factor(c(rep("PRE", 111), rep("I", 111)),
                  levels = c("PRE", "I"))
ggplot(df, aes(V, EF, colour = Euro)) + geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_line() + theme_bw()+
  labs(y = "CO[g/km]", x = "[km/h]")
```

### Emission factors of HDV depending on  speed with the function `ef_hdv_speed`


The arguments for `ef_hdv_speed` are:

```{r}
args(ef_hdv_speed)
```

- `v`	:Category vehicle: "Coach", "Trucks" or "Ubus"
- `t`	Sub-category of of vehicle: "3Axes", "Artic", "Midi", "RT, "Std" and "TT"
- `g`	Gross weight of each category: "<=18", ">18", "<=15", ">15 & <=18", "<=7.5", - ">7.5 & <=12", ">12 & <=14", ">14 & <=20", ">20 & <=26", ">26 & <=28", ">28 & <=32", ">32", ">20 & <=28", ">28 & <=34", ">34 & <=40", ">40 & <=50" or ">50 & <=60"
- `eu	Euro emission standard: "PRE", "I", "II", "III", "IV" and "V"
- `gr	Gradient or slope of road: -0.06, -0.04, -0.02, 0.00, 0.02. 0.04 or 0.06
- `l`	Load of the vehicle: 0.0, 0.5 or 1.0
- `p`	Pollutant: "CO", "FC", "NOx" or "HC"
- `k`	Multiplication factor
- `show.equation`	Option to see or not the equation parameters

```{r}
V <- 0:130
ef1 <- ef_hdv_speed(v = "Trucks",t = "RT", g = "<=7.5",
                    e = "II", gr = 0,
l = 0.5, p = "HC", show.equation = FALSE)
ef2 <- ef_hdv_speed(v = "Trucks",t = "RT", g = "<=7.5",
                    e = "II", gr = 0.06,
l = 0.5, p = "HC", show.equation = FALSE)
plot(1:130, ef1(1:130), pch = 16, type = "b",
     ylab = "HC [g/km]", xlab = "Speed [km/h]")
lines(1:130, ef2(1:130), pch = 16, type = "b", col = "blue")

```

## Local emission factors by age of use. The functions `EmissionFactors` and `EmissionFactorsList` {#localef}

The functions `EmissionFactors` and `EmissionFactorsList` creates the classes
with the same names. The class `EmissionFactors` is also a data-frame with
numeric columns with units of $g \cdot km^{-1}$. This class is not used in 
critical steps of VEIN, and it has a purpose of only creating data-frame with
numeric columns with units. The this function is applied to a numeric vector,
it just convert it to `units` adding units to it.

In the case of `EmissionFactorsList`, this class is a list of functions $f(V)$.
This is usefull because the `emis` function, seen in detail on chapter
\@ref(est), requires that the emission factors are functions of Velocity $f(V)$, 
regardless $f(V)$ is constant or not. When this function is applied to a 
data-frame or to a matrix, it returns a list and each columns of the data-frame 
or matrix is another list. Also, each row of the original data-frame is converted
to a $f(V)$. 

The arguements or `EmissionFactorsList` and `EmissionFactors` are:

-`x`: Object with class "data.frame", "matrix" or "numeric"

The following lines of ode show examples using `EmissionFactors`. Firstly, it
is loaded the dataset of emission factors _fe2015_ for CO and the vehicles
PC using gasoline PC_G and Light Trucks LT. The class of fe2015 is data-frame.
The subset of the data is named DF_CO. When we see the first 6 elemens of the
data-frame are numbers without units.

```{r}
library(vein)
data(fe2015) #CETESB Emission factors
DF_CO <- fe2015[fe2015$Pollutant=="CO", c("PC_G", "LT")]
head(DF_CO)
```

The object EF_CO has class`EmissionFactors` and "data-frame" and each 
observation has the units $g \cdot km^{-1}$.

```{r}
EF_CO <- EmissionFactors(DF_CO)
head(EF_CO)
class(EF_CO)
```

The plot of an object with class `EmissionFactors` shows maximum 9 emission
factors. Fig. (\@ref(fig:efco)) shows the emission factors of both categories,
where newer vehicles emit less and older vehicles emit more.

```{r efco, fig.cap='Emission factor of PC and LT by age of use', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
plot(EF_CO, xlab = "Age of use")
```

Regarding the class `EmissionFactorsList`, the `print` and `summary` methods
are very simply, ony showing a description of the object. The example of
the following lines of code also uses the same set of Emission Factors from
-@CETESB2015. The resulting object, EF_COL, has class `EmissionFactorsList` and
`list`. The print of the object shows only a description of the first and
last member of the list object.


```{r}
EFL_CO <- EmissionFactorsList(DF_CO)
class(EFL_CO)
EFL_CO
```

Indeed, we want to see the content of the `EmissionFactorsList` we would have to
extract the elements of the list. EFL_CO has two list, each one for PC and LT.
Then, each list has 36 functions, the command `class(EFL_CO[[1]][[1]])` shows
the object is a functon $f(V)$.

```{r}
EFL_CO[[1]][[1]]
```

Also, as the speed functions are constant, there is no need to add values of V. 

```{r}
EFL_CO[[1]][[1]](100) # constant speed function
EFL_CO[[1]][[1]](0)   # constant speed function
```

Finally, after extracting the value, Fig.
(\@ref(fig:efco2)) shows the same figure as Fig. (\@ref(fig:efco))

```{r efco2, fig.cap='Emission factor of PC and LT', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
efco1 <- sapply(1:36, function(i) EFL_CO[[1]][[i]]())
efco2 <- sapply(1:36, function(i) EFL_CO[[2]][[i]]())
df <- EmissionFactors(cbind(efco1, efco2))
plot(df, xlab = "Age of use")

```

## Incorporating speed variation with the functions `ef_ldv_scaled` and `ef_hdv_scaled`  {#scale}

The functions on section \@ref(speedef) and \@ref(localef) showed the speed
and local emission factors respectivly. However, the user might have local
and constant emission factors depending only on age of use, but also, outputs
from a traffic demand model which includes speed. Under those circumnstances, it
would be interesting to investigate the effects of the average speed of traffic
flow. VEIN includes a function to transform a constant emission factor by age of
use into a speed dependent function.

This functions are called `ef_ldv_scaled` and `ef_hdv_scaled`. The concept is
explained in detail in my Ph.D thesis [@ibarrathesis]. The idea is comes from 
revisitng the nature of the local emission factors. The Brazilian emission 
factors consist of average measurements emissions certification tests which use 
the  driving cycles Federal Test Procedure FTP-75 for LDV, World Motorcycle Test 
Cycle (WMTC) for motorcycles, and also the European Stationary Cycle (ESC) for 
HDV [@CETESB2015]. The average speed of FTP-75 and WMTC are known, being 34.2
$km \cdot h^{-1}$ and 54.7 $km \cdot h^{-1}$ based to the reference report on
driving cycles from the Transport and Research Laboratory (TRL) [@tim]. In the
case of ESC, the user might search on literature a way to relate this cycle
with an average speed.

Coming back to the -@CETESB2015 emission factors, these are annual average values
of emissions for the different technologies to accomplish Brazilian emission 
standards, which are valid only for a specific average speed.If two vehicles have
similar technology but different emission factors, one constant and other speed
function, it would be possble to relate them. These functions use the speed to 
relate both emission factors. The condition to transform a contant emission
factor into a speed dependent function is that, the new speed dependent function
must be the same value at the speed which is representative the local factor,
and the values at other speeds are the incorporation of the speed variation.
The equation \@ref(eq:efscaled) shows the procedure:

\begin{equation}
EF_{scaled}(V_{i,l})_{j,k,m}=EF(V_{i,l})_{j,k,m} \cdot \frac{EFlocal_{j,k,m}}{{EF(Vdc_{i,l})_{j,k,m}}}
(\#eq:efscaled)
\end{equation}

Where $EF_{scaled}(V_{i,l})_{j,k,m}$ is the scaled emission factor and 
$EF(V_{i,l})_{j,k,m}$ is the Copert emission factor for each street link $i$,
vehicle from composition $k$, hour $l$ and pollutant $m$. $EFlocal_{j,k,m}$
represents the constant emission factor (not as speed functions). 
$EF(Vdc_{i,l})_{j,k,m}$ are Copert emission factors with average speed value of
the respective driving cycle for the vehicular category $j$. 

The functions `ef_ldv_scaled` and `ef_hdv`_scaled` returns scaled emissions
factors automatically. The arguments are:

- `df`: Data-frame with emission factors (Deprecated in 0.3.10).
- `dfcol`: Numeric vector with the emission factors constant by age of use. These
emission factors are the target to incorporate peed variation.
- `SDC`: A number with the speed of the driving cycle of the emission factors
from the argumetn `dfcol`. The resulting speed functions will return the same
values of dfcol at the speed `SDC`. The default is 34.12 "km/h".
- `v`. Category vehicle: "PC", "LCV", "Motorcycle" or "Moped". 
- `t`. Character; sub-category of of vehicle: PC: "ECE_1501", "ECE_1502",
"ECE_1503", "ECE_1504" , "IMPROVED_CONVENTIONAL", "OPEN_LOOP", "ALL", "2S" or "4S".
LCV: "4S", Motorcycle: "2S" or "4S". Moped: "2S" or "4S". The default is `4S`.
- `cc`. Character; size of engine in cc: PC: "<=1400", ">1400", "1400_2000", 
">2000", "<=800", "<=2000". Motorcycle: ">=50" (for "2S"), "<=250", "250_750", 
">=750". Moped: "<=50". LCV : "<3.5" for gross weight.
- `f`: Character; type of fuel: "G", "D", "LPG" or "FH" (Full Hybrid: starts by 
electric motor).
- `eu`: Character; euro standard: "PRE", "I", "II", "III", "III+DPF", "IV", "V", "VI" or "VIc".
- `p`: Character; pollutant: "CO", "FC", "NOx", "HC" or "PM".

And the argument of `ef_hdv_scaled` are:

## Cold Starts

Cold start emissions are produced during engine startup, when the engine and/or
catalytic converter system has not reached its normal operational temperature. Sev-
eral studies have shown the significant impact for these types of emissions 
[@chenetal2011, @Weilenmannetal2009]. Under this condition emissions will be 
higher, and if the atmospheric temperature decreases, cold start emissions will 
increase regardless of whether the catalyst has reached its optimum temperature for
functioning [@artemis]. VEIN also considers cold start emissions using the approach
outlined in Copert [@NtziachristosSamaras2016], as shown in equation 
\@ref(eq:cold).

\begin{equation}
EC_{i,j,k,l,m} =\beta_{j} \cdot F_{i,j,k,l} \cdot L_i \cdot EF(V_{i,l})_{j,k,m} \cdot DF_{j.k} \cdot \left(EF_{\mbox{cold}}(ta_n,V_{i,l})_{j,k,m}-1\right)
(\#eq:cold)
\end{equation}

This approach adds two terms to Eq. \ref{eq:emi}. The first term
$EF_{cold}(ta_n,V_{i,l})_{j,k,m}-1$ is the emission factors for cold start 
conditions at each street link $i$, vehicle category from composition $k$, hour $l$
and pollutant $m$ and monthly average temperature $n$.
[@NtziachristosSamaras2016] suggest using monthly average temperature. This is an 
important aspect that will be reviewed in future versions of VEIN.

The second term $\beta_j$ is defined as the fraction of mileage driven with a cold 
engine/catalyst [@NtziachristosSamaras2016]. The VEIN model incorporates a dataset 
of cold starts recorded during the implementation of the International Vehicle 
Emissions (IVE) model [@Davisetal2005] in São Paulo [@ivesp], which 
provides the hourly mileage driven with cold start conditions.

The function for cold start emission factors is `ef_ldv_cold` and their arguments
are:

```{r}
args(ef_ldv_cold)
```

where:

- `v`:	 Category vehicle: "LDV".
- `ta`: Ambient temperature. Monthly men can be used.
- `cc`: Size of engine in cc: "<=1400", "1400_2000" or ">2000".
- `f`: Type of fuel: "G", "D" or "LPG".
- `eu`: Euro standard: "PRE", "I", "II", "III", "IV", "V", "VI" or "VIc".
- `p`: Pollutant: "CO", "FC", "NOx", "HC" or "PM".
- `k`: Multiplication factor.
- `show.equation`: Option to see or not the equation parameters.


```{r}
ef1 <- ef_ldv_cold(ta = -5, cc = "<=1400", f ="G", eu = "I", p = "CO")
ef2 <- ef_ldv_cold(ta = 0, cc = "<=1400", f ="G", eu = "I", p = "CO")
ef3 <- ef_ldv_cold(ta = 5, cc = "<=1400", f ="G", eu = "I", p = "CO")
ef4 <- ef_ldv_cold(ta = 10, cc = "<=1400", f ="G", eu = "I", p = "CO")
```

```{r efcold, fig.cap='Cold Emission factor of PC CO (g/km)', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
V <- 0:100
df <- data.frame(EF = c(ef1(V), ef2(V), ef3(V), ef4(V) ))
df$Speed <- V
df$Temperature <- factor(c(rep("-5", length(V)),
                    rep( "0", length(V)),
                    rep("5", length(V)),
                    rep("10", length(V))),
                    levels = c("10", "5", "0", "-5"))
ggplot(df, aes(x = Speed, y = EF, colour = Temperature)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) + geom_line() +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "Speed [g/km]", y = "CO [g/km]")
```

There is another function called `ef_ldv_cold_list` which will be deprecated soon.

## Deterioration {#det}

By default, VEIN includes deterioration factors from Copert 
[@NtziachristosSamaras2016]. However, it is possible to include other sources,
such as from [@CorvalanVargas2003] or included deteriorated local emission
factors. This aspesct is faced in vein with the function `emis_det`. This
function returns deteriorated factors, as numeric vectors, which must be multiplied
with the emission factors of vehicles with 0 mileage.

The arguments of this functions are:

```{r}
args(emis_det)
```

where:

- `p`: Pollutant.
- `cc`: Size of engine in cc.
- `eu`: Euro standard: "PRE", "I", "II", "III", "III", "IV", "V", "VI".
- `km`: mileage in km. VEIN includes a dataset of mileage function named "fkm".

```{r efDET, fig.cap='Deteriorated (red) and not-deteriorated (blue) EF CO', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}

data(fe2015)
data(fkm)
pckma <- cumsum(fkm$KM_PC_E25(1:24)) #only vehicles with catalizer
x1 <- fe2015[fe2015$Pollutant == "CO", ]
x1E3 <- subset(x1, x1$Euro_LDV %in% c("III", "IV", "V"))$PC_G
x1E1 <- subset(x1, x1$Euro_LDV %in% c("I", "II"))$PC_G
det_E3 <- emis_det(po = "CO", cc = 1000, eu = "III",
                   km = pckma[1:length(x1E3)])
det_E1 <- emis_det(po = "CO", cc = 1000, eu = "III",
                   km = pckma[(length(x1E3) + 1):23 ])
original_EF <- x1$PC
deteriorated_EF <- x1$PC * c(det_E3, det_E1, rep(1, 13))

```

## Evaporative emissions `ef_evap`

Evaporative emissions are important sources of hydrocarbons and these emissions are
produced by vaporization of fuel due to variations in ambient temperatures
[@MelliosNtziachristos2016, @Andradeetal2017]. There are three types of emissions: 
**diurnal emissions**, due to increases in atmospheric temperature, which lead to 
thermal expansion of vapor fuel inside the tank; **running losses**, when the fuel
evaporates inside the tank due to normal operation of the vehicle; and **hot soak**
emissions, which occur when the hot engine is turned off. These methods implemented
in VEIN were sourced from the evaporative emissions methods of Copert Tier 2 
[@MelliosNtziachristos2016]. VEIN it is also possible to use local emission
factors. Here I'm showing both approaches:

a) Tier 2 copert approach

\begin{equation}
EV_{j,k} =\sum_{s}D_{s} \cdot \sum_{j}F_{j} \cdot (HS_{j,k}+de_{j,k}+RL_{j,k}) 
(\#eq:ev1)
\end{equation}

where $EV_{j}$ are the volatile organic compounds (VOC) evaporative emissions due 
to each type of vehicle $j$. $D_s$ is the "seasonal days" or number of days when 
the mean monthly temperature is within a determined range: 
[-5$^{\circ}$,10$^{\circ}$C],  [0$^{\circ}$,  15$^{\circ}$C], [10$^{\circ}$, 
25$^{\circ}$C] and [20$^{\circ}$, 35$^{\circ}$C]. $F_{j,k}$ is the number of 
vehicles according to the same type $j$ and age of use $k$. $HS_{j,k}$, $de_{j,k}$ 
and $RL_{j,k}$ are average hot/warm soak, diurnal and running losses evaporative 
emissions ($\mathrm{g \cdot day^{-1}}$), respectively, according to the vehicle 
type $j$ and age of use $k$. $HS_{j,k}$ and $RL_{j,k}$ are obtained using equations
also sourced from [@MelliosNtziachristos2016]:

\begin{equation}
HS_{j,k} = x_{j,k} \cdot (c \cdot (p \cdot e_{shc}+(1-p) \cdot e_{swc})+(1-c) \cdot e_{shfi} )
(\#eq:ev2)
\end{equation}

where $x$ are the number of trips per day for the vehicular type $j$ and age of use
$k$. $c$ is the fraction of vehicles with fuel return systems. $p$ is the fraction
of trips finished with hot engine, for example, an engine that has reached its
normal operating temperature and the catalyst has reached its light-off temperature
[@NtziachristosSamaras2016]. The light-off temperature is the temperature at the
point when catalytic reactions occur inside a catalytic converter. $e_{shc}$ and
$e_{swc}$ are average hot-soak and warm-soak emission factors for gasoline vehicles
with carburettor or fuel return systems ($\mathrm{g \cdot parking^{-1}}$).
$e_{shfi}$  is the average hot-soak emission factors for gasoline vehicles equipped
with fuel injection and non-return fuel systems ($\mathrm{g \cdot parking^{-1}}$).
The Eq. \@ref(eq:ev3) shows the procedure.

\begin{equation}
RL_{j,k} = x_{j,k} \cdot (c \cdot (p \cdot e_{rhc}+(1-p) \cdot e_{rwc})+(1-c) \cdot e_{rhfi} )
(\#eq:ev3)
\end{equation}


$x$ and $p$ have the same meanings of Eq. \@ref(eq:ev2). $e_{rhc}$ and  $e_{rwc}$
are average hot and warm running losses emission factors for gasoline vehicles with
carburettor or fuel return systems ($\mathrm{g \cdot trip^{-1}}$) and $e_{rhfi}$
are average hot running losses emission factors for gasoline vehicles equipped with
fuel injection and non-return fuel systems ($\mathrm{g \cdot trip^{-1}}$).
It is recommended to estimate the number of trips per day
[@MelliosNtziachristos2016], $x$, as the division between the mileage and 365 times
the length of trip: $x = \frac{mileage_j}{(365 \cdot ltrip)}$. However, the
mileage of a vehicle is not constant throughout the years. Therefore, VEIN
incorporates a dataset of equations to estimate mileage of different types of
vehicles by age of use [@BruniBales2013].

The function for evaporative emission factors is `ef_evap` and it arguments:

```{r}
args(ef_evap)
```

where:

- `ef`:	Name of evaporative emission factor as *eshotc* ($g \cdot proced^-1$): mean 
hot-soak with carburator, *eswarmc* ($g \cdot proced^-1$): mean cold and warm-soak 
with carburator, eshotfi: mean hot-soak with fuel injection, *erhotc*  ($g \cdot 
trip^-1$): mean hot running losses with  carburator, *erwarmc*  ($g \cdot trip^-1$) 
mean cold and warm running losses, *erhotfi*  ($g \cdot trip^-1$) mean hot running 
losses with fuel injection.

- `v`:	Type of vehicles, "PC", "Motorcycles", "Motorcycles_2S" and "Moped"
- `cc`: Size of engine in cc. PC "<=1400", "1400_2000" and "2000" Motorcycles_2S: "<=50". Motorcyces: ">50", "<250", "250_750" and ">750"
- `dt`: Average daily temperature variation: "-5_10", "0_15", "10_25" and "20_35"
- `ca`: Size of canister: "no" meaning no canister, "small", "medium" and "large"
- `k`: multiplication factor
- `show`: when TRUE shows row of table with respective emission factor.

Example:

```{r rlevap, echo = TRUE, fig.cap='Running losses evaporative emission actors (g/trip)', out.width='100%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center', warning=FALSE}
library(vein)
library(ggplot2)
library(cptcity)
dt <- c("-5_10", "0_15", "10_25", "20_35")
ef <- sapply(1:4, function(i){
  ef_evap(ef = "erhotc",v = "PC", cc = "<=1400",
                dt = dt[i], ca = "no",
                show = TRUE)
})
df <- data.frame(ef = ef, temp = c(0, 10, 20, 30))
source("theme_black.R")
ggplot(df, aes(x = temp, y = ef)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = cpt(n = 4), col = "white") + 
  labs(x = "Temperature[C]", y = "RL Evaporative NMHC [g/trip]") + 
  theme_black()
```


b) Alternative approach

The evaporative emission factors mentioned before are suitable for top-down
estimations. That approach also requires knowledge of the 'procedure' and
'trips'. In this section it is introduced an alternative which consists in
transform the emission factors into $g \cdot km^-1$ and then do a bottom-up
estimation.

In order to do that, we need to follows assumptions. First, we consider that
the number of procedures is equal to trips. Then estimates how many trips per 
day are produced each day and then estiamtes how many kilometers are driven
each day and convert th emission factors as shown on Eq. \@ref(eq:efev2).

\begin{equation}
EF_{ev}(\frac{g}{km})=EF(_{ev})(\frac{g}{trip}) \cdot A(\frac{trips}{day}) \cdot B(\frac{km}{day})^{-1}
(\#eq:efev2)
\end{equation}

Clearly, we need to know A $(\frac{trips}{day})$ and B$(\frac{km}{day})^{-1}$.
Diurnal evaporative emissions factors are expressed as  $(\frac{g}{day})$. To
conbvert to  $(\frac{g}{km})$ we only need the kilometers driven each day
$\frac{km}{day}^{-1}$.

Now, it will be shown an example with the evaporative emission factors from 
-@CETESB2015. These emission factors are based on the methodology Tier 2 from 
-@@MelliosNtziachristos2016. If we consider evaporative emission factors of 
Passenger Cars using Gasoline (blended with 25\% of Ethanol) [@CETESB2015] and
4.6 $(\frac{trips}{day})$ [@ibarrathesis].

```{r echo = FALSE}
evap <- readRDS("rds/evappc.rds")
head(evap)
```
The variable ed_20_35 are diurnal evaporative emission factors in $g \cdot day^{-1}$
and eshot_20_35 and erhot_20_35  $g \cdot trip^{-1}$.

```{r efEVAP, fig.cap='Hot Soak (blue), Diurnal (green) and Running Losses (red) EF (g/km)', out.width='100%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}

library(vein)
data(fkm)
evap$ed_20_35_gkm <- evap$ed_20_35 / fkm$KM_PC_E25(1:41)/365
evap$eshot_20_35_gkm <- evap$eshot_20_35 * 4.6/ fkm$KM_PC_E25(1:41)/365
evap$erhot_20_35_gkm <- evap$erhot_20_35  * 4.6/ fkm$KM_PC_E25(1:41)/365
plot(x = 1:41, y = evap$eshot_20_35_gkm, col = "blue", 
     type = "b", pch = 16,
     xlab = "Age of use", ylab = "EV NMHC [g/km]")
lines(x = 1:41, y = evap$ed_20_35_gkm, col = "red", 
      type = "b", pch = 15)
lines(x = 1:41, y = evap$erhot_20_35_gkm, col = "green", 
      type = "b", pch = 17)

```


## Emission factors of wear `ef_wear` 

Wear emissions are very important because they contribute with an important
fraction of PM from tyre and break wear. VEIN includes these functions from
-@NtziachristosBoulter2009 which incudewear emissions factors form tyre, break
and road abrassion.

The arguments are:

```{r}
args(ef_wear)
```

- `wear`: Character; type of wear: "tyre", "break" and "road"
type: Character; type of vehicle: "2W", "PC", "LCV", 'HDV"
- `pol`: Character; pollutant: "TSP", "PM10", "PM2.5", "PM1" and "PM0.1"
- `speed`: List of speeds
- `load`: Load of the HDV
- `axle`: Number of axle of the HDV

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(vein)
?ef_wear
```

## Emission factors from tunnel studies

With VEIN you can choose three type of emissions factors, speed functions,
local emission factors or scaled factors. In this section i will show how to
expand the use of local emission factors considering tunnel emission factors
[@perez2014emission], from the International Vehicle Emissions (IVE) Model 
[@Davisetal2005] applied in Colombia [@gonzalez2017relative].

-@perez2014emission measured air pollutant concentrations in two tunnels in São
Paulo city, one with predominant use of LDV vehicles and another with more HDV.
The resulting emission factors for the fleet are shown on Table \@ref(tab:eftun).

```{r eftun, echo=FALSE}
df <- EmissionFactors(data.frame(CO = c(5.8, 3.6),
                 NOx = c(0.3, 9.2)))
row.names(df) <- c("LDV", "HDV")
knitr::kable(df, 
  caption = 'Emission factors from tunnels in São Paulo 2014',
  booktabs = TRUE
)
```

If we want to compare with the -@CETESB2015 emission factors, we would have to
weight these factors with the fleet. The weight mean emission factor of CO and
Passenger Cars (PC) is 1.40 $g \cdot km^{-1}$ and for Light Trucks (LT) is
0.60 $g \cdot km^{-1}$. In the case of NOx, Passenger Cars (PC) is 0.16 $g \cdot 
km^{-1}$ and for Light Trucks (LT) is 3.24 $g \cdot km^{-1}$. The emission factors 
from the example are for vehicles with 0 kilometers without deterioration. Anyways, 
tunnel emission factors are higher that the weighted emission factors from CETESB.

```{r}
library(vein)
data(fe2015)
fecoPC <- fe2015[fe2015$Pollutant == "CO", "PC_G"]
fecoLT <- fe2015[fe2015$Pollutant == "CO", "LT"]
fenoxPC <- fe2015[fe2015$Pollutant == "NOx", "PC_G"]
fenoxLT <- fe2015[fe2015$Pollutant == "NOx", "LT"]
PC <- age_ldv(x = 1, name = "PC", agemax = 36, message = FALSE)
LT <- age_hdv(x = 1, name = "LT", agemax = 36, message = FALSE)
weighted.mean(fecoPC, PC)  # PC CO
weighted.mean(fecoLT, LT)  # LT CO
weighted.mean(fenoxPC, PC) # PC NOx 
weighted.mean(fenoxLT, LT) # LT NOx
```

If the user want to use tunnel emission factors from -@perez2014emission in VEIN, 
the user would have to use the same value for all respective categories of the
vehicular composition. For instance, after running `inventory`, include tunnel
emission factors in each `*input.R`.

## Emission factors from International Vehicle Emissions (IVE)

The IVE models applies the  vehicle specific power (VSP) methodology to predict
emissions [@jimenez1999vehicle]. The formlula is shown on Eq. \@ref(eq:vsp).

\begin{equation}
VSP = v \cdot (1.1 \cdot a + 9.81(atan(sin(grade))) + 0.132) + 0.000302v^3
(\#eq:vsp)
\end{equation}

where $v$ is velocity $(m \cdot s^{-1})$, $a$ is the second by second acceleration
$(m \cdot s^{-2})$ and grade the second by second change in height defined as
$\frac{(h_{t=0} - h_{t=-1})}{v}$; being $h$ as altitude $m$. This method requires
that the user measures the activity Global Position System (GPS) recordings 
second by second and/or emissions measurements with Portable Emissions Measurement
Systems (PEMS).

-@gonzalez2017relative measure the vehicular activity in the city of Manizales,
Colombia. In htis case, there were not PEMS measurements, but IVE allows to
produce emission factors from the GPS recordings based on Mobile EPA emissions
model[@arbor2003user, @Davisetal2005].

The resulting emission factors varies for each type of vehicle and includes several 
pollutants. If the user wants to use IVE emission factors in vein would have to 
add them in each `*input.R`, after running `inventory`.
