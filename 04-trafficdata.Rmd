# Traffic data {#traffic}

Traffic data is read in VEIN as spatial information. In other words, traffic data
must in any vectorial line spatial format with the drivers provided by the 
library **GDAL** (http://www.gdal.org/ogr_formats.html) called by the packages
**rgdal** or **sf**. This means that traffic data must in in any GDAL spatial
format. The Eq. \@ref(eq:flow) show how traffic data is treated into vein. 

\begin{equation}
F^*_{i,j,k} = Q_{i} \cdot VC_{i,j} \cdot Age_{j,k}
(\#eq:flow)
\end{equation}

where $F^*_{i,j,k}$ is the vehicular flow at street link $i$ for vehicle type $j$ by
age of use $k$. $j$ defines the vehicular composition according to their type of 
use, type of fuel, size of engine and gross weight, based on definitions of
[@Corvalanetal2002]. $Q_i$ is the traffic flow at street link $i$. $VC_{i,j}$ is
the fraction of vehicles varying according to the type of vehicles $j$ in the
composition for street link $i$.  $Age_{j,k}$ is the age distribution by vehicular
composition $j$ and age of use $k$. This Equation shows that $VC$ splits the total
vehicular flow $Q$ to identify the vehicular fraction, which varies according to the
type of fuel, size of motor and gross weight. For example, if $Q$ is light duty
vehicles (LDV) and it is known that 5\% of the $Q$ are passenger cars (PC), with
engine lesser than 1400 cc, $VC$ is 0.05. This characterization of the fleet depends
on the amount and quality of the available information. VEIN then multiplies the
traffic with $Age$ to obtain the amount of each type of vehicle by age of use. 


## Sources of traffic data

### Travel demand outputs

VEIN was developepd according to the available traffic data in São Pauo, Brazil.
In this case, the available data was a 4-stage macroscopic travel
model for morning rush hour and hourly traffic counts for morning and evening
rush hours. The travel model is based on data from an Origin-Destination-Survey 
(ODS) [@ODS] which started in the decade of 1950 in São Paulo. A classic reference 
of a 4-stage modeling transport is [@OrtuzarWillumsen2002]. The 4 stages of the 
traffic modeling includes characterization of trip attractions and productions by
zone in some regions, distribution of these trips, preferred mode of transport for
traveling and finally the allocation of the trips at each mode, in this case into
the road network. The ODS is made every 10 years by Metro (http://www.metro.sp.gov.br/),
which is the underground company, and they perform a smaller update of ODS after
5 years. The information gathered in the ODS is massive with the participation of
thousands of commuters. It helps to identify characteristics of the trips inside
MASP. CET uses the information from ODS and performs the traffic simulation. In
this case, it is a macro or strategic traffic simulation which represents the
equilibrium between offer and supply of transportation at maximum load of the
road network, that is, at the rush hour, which is from 08:00 to 09:00 Local Time (LT).

VEIN incorporates an extract of a traffic model simulation for the west part of
São Paulo named *net*. The Fig. (\@ref(fig:ldv) shows the traffic of Light Duty
Vehicles (LDV). This data covers the surrounding area of the University of São
Paulo. The information obtained from CET consists in:

- _ldv_: Light Duty Vehicles (1/h).
- _hdv_: Heavy Duty Vehicles (1/h).
- _lkm_: Length of the link (km).
- _ps_: Peak Speed (km/h).
- _ffs_: Free Flow Speed (km/h).
- _tstreet_: Type of street.
- _lanes_: Number of lanes per link.
- _capacity_: Capacity of vehicles in each link (1/h).
- _tmin_: Time for travelling each link (min).

The following scripts show how to load this data in R. This data has the class
"SpatialLinesDataFrame" from the package [@sp]. This data was converted into
an spatial feature "sf" object [@sf] because it consists in a data-frame with a
list-column of geometry with the spatial attributes and it is easier to handle
than an object class of sp. As entioned, future versions of VEIN will migrate
to sf.

The user must call the library vein first, then load the data net. The object
net has the class "SpatialLinesDataFrame". This data can be seen loaded in R as:

```{r}
library(vein)
library(sp)
data(net)
class(net)
```

The Fig. (\@ref(fig:ldv)) shows that traffic is concentrated in mains streets
such as motorway Marginal Pinheiros, located at the north east part of the area. 

```{r ldv, fig.cap='LDV at 08:00-09:00 (LT) in west São Paulo', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
library(vein)
data(net)
net$ldv <- as.numeric(net$ldv)
spplot(net, "ldv", scales = list(draw = T),
       col.regions = rev(bpy.colors(16)))
```

### Inteprolation of traffic counts

Travel model simulation are not always available and the user interested in
estimating vehicular emisisons with a bottom-up approach would have to look
for alternatives to obtain traffic data at street level. These alternatives
covers interpolating traffic data for different temporal resolutions. For
instance, -@requia developed a vehicular bottom-up inventory using traffic
counts and a geostatistic method called Global Moran's I test [@anselin]. It 
measures the spatial autocorrelation. However, this technique requires that the
observed values are normal, which is not the case for count data.

Other authors were instested in predicting Anual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) or
only ADT. -@lowry2014spatial presented a new method for predicting AADT based on
the concept of origin-destination centrality. The idea is to obtain predictor
variables directly from the road network. He identified origin and destination
zones and added multiplication factors based on the land-use characteristics.

-@zhao2001contributing tested several multiple stepwise regressions incorporating
land-use characteristics. They considered several variables: number of lanes,
classificatiion of road type, employment numbers and access to expressway with
correlations between 0.66 and 0.82. -@lam2000estimation compared neural networks
and regressions for a dataset of 13 locations. Kriging methods were used in AADT
interpolation by -@eom2006improving, who predicted AADT for non-motorway streets.
Also, -@selby2013spatial compared Kriging and geographically weighted regressions
in the prediction of AADT.

Another approach is to perform a spatial regression based on the distributio
on the oberved data. As the data is counts of traffic, a poisson, quasi-poisson
or negative binomial regressions can be used [@zeileis2008regression]. Recently,
-@Ibarraetal2017a compared quasi-posson and negative binomial regresions
predicting hourly traffic data, with better results with quasi-poisson approach
and correlation of 0.72.

Newer approaches involves using GPS data from smart phones and cars. 

### Generating traffic flows from Origin-Destination-Surveys (ODS)

The origin destination survey (ODS) is an important tool which quantifies the 
amount of trips generated in the study area. ODS studies started decades ago. The
oldest ODS paper on Google Scholar is entitles "FUNCTIONS OF A HIGHWAY-PLANNING SURVEY DEPARTMENT" by W. J. Sapp in 1938 at the TWENTY-FOURTH ANNUAL ROAD SCHOOL
[@sapp1938runctions]. In this paper it is discussed the importance information
for the trffic engineer, and Sapp even mentios: "The engineer must have the supporting data available to substantiate his decisions."

Other study of 1942 shows talks about the importance of traffic counts, disucssing
the elaboration of an origin destination survey where 8000 Boy Scouts of America
participated counting traffic. The method for analyzing the data consisted in
countign the vehicles identifying the licence plate in order to determine the
origin (the first time the vehicle was recorded), the route of vehicles, the
destination and the approximate time for the trip.

After those pioneer studies many many other studies went deeper into the subject. 
And after that, with the irruption of new technologies, new software, use of 
smarthphones with GPS, satellites and big technological centers own by companies 
such as Google (http://www.google.com), new ways for characterizing trips were
developed. In this section i will briefly mention the Google Distance Matrix 
(https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/), the
pgRouting library [@patrushev2007shortest] for postGIS and will expand with two R
packages, googleway [@googleway] and dodgr [@dodgr].

The ODS will provide us the matrix of pairs of zones origin and destinations by 
mode of transport. Then, we can use any of the mentiones softwares to find the
shortest path between each zone. The table \@ref(tab:ods) shows an extraction of 
the OD matrix for the Metropolitan Area of São Paulo (MASP) in 2007 for motorized individual trips. The fig \@ref(fig.zod) shows a map with the location of the zones OD.

```{r ods,  echo = FALSE}
m <- read.csv("~/MEGA/PhDgrive/Dados/OD2007-METRO/Tabelas com dados gerais da Pesquisa Origem e Destino 2007/Tab32_OD2007_individual_PICO.csv", h = F, sep = ";")
m <- as.matrix(m[101:110,101:110])
knitr::kable(m, 
             caption = 'Matrix OD for motorized indivitual trips between 06:30 and 08:30 MASP 2007',
             booktabs = TRUE,
             align = "c"
)
```


```{r zod, fig.cap='Zones OD for MASP 2007', out.width='100%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, messages = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
zod <- sf::st_read("~/MEGA/PhDgrive/Dados/OD2007-METRO/od.shp", quiet = T)
plot(zod$geometry, axes = T, main = NULL)
```

Now, as we know the the trips between each pair of OD zones, we can find the
routes that connectes them. A used algorithm is the shortest path, which connects
two nodes minimizing the total travel time. There are several algorithms, 
including -@dijkstra1959note.

#### Google Distance Matrix API

This we servise allow to "retrieve duration and distance values based on the
recommended route between start and end points." It returns durations and
distance, it is possible to choose modes of transport and even to choose between
current or historial times. The first step is to get a KEY.

If you browser

```{bash eval = FALSE}
https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/distancematrix/json?units=imperial&origins=Washington,DC&destinations=New+York+City,NY&key=YOUR_API_KEY
```

and replace YOUR_API_KEY you will see (my brower is in portuguese):

```{bash eval = FALSE}
{
  "destination_addresses" : [ "Nova York, NY, EUA" ],
  "origin_addresses" : [ "Washington, D.C., Distrito de Columbia, EUA" ],
  "rows" : [
    {
      "elements" : [
        {
          "distance" : {
            "text" : "225 mi",
            "value" : 361972
          },
          "duration" : {
            "text" : "3 horas 53 minutos",
            "value" : 13964
          },
          "status" : "OK"
        }
        ]
    }
    ],
  "status" : "OK"
}
```

The modes of transport covered are **driving** using the road network, 
**walking** via pedestrian paths & sidewalks, **bicycling** via bicycle paths and
**transit** via public transit routes. For more information read the 
documentation.

#### pgRouting for postGIS

pgRouting (http://pgrouting.org/) is an open source routing library for postGIS.
It provides many routing algorithms and it can be run via QGIS 
(https://www.qgis.org). This library is very extensive. A good resource is the
book "pgRouting: A Practical Guide" (http://locatepress.com/pgrouting).

#### The R package googleway

googleway [@googleway] R package allows to access Goolge Maps API https://developers.google.com/maps/.
The API functions are:

- Directions - `google_directions()`
- Distance Matrix - `google_distance()`
- Elevation - `google_elevation()`
- Geocoding - `google_geocode()`
- Reverse Geocoding - `google_reverse_geocode()`
- Places - `google_places()`
- Place Details - `google_place_details()`
- Time zone - `google_timezone()`
- Roads - `google_snapToRoads()` and `google_nearestRoads()`

This package allows to plot over Google Maps. 

```{r}
library(googleway)
## not specifying the api will add the key as your 'default'
key <- "my_api_key"
set_key(key = key)
google_keys()
```

From zone Luz 7, coordinates long -46.63461 and lat  -23.53137 to zone 8 Bom 
Retiro coordinates -46.64482 -23.52204 there are 133 LDV trips between 6:30 and
08:30. We first create the data-frame. This data is based on OD from São Paulo.

```{r }
mydf <- data.frame(region = 1,
                   from_lat = -23.53137,
                   from_long = -46.634613,
                   to_lat = -23.52204,
                   to_long = -46.64482)
```


```{r echo=FALSE}
mykey <- "AIzaSyDQJfIQUR-XzpC8Mmg8XNbFQE5rNp9DAgE"
```

Then we use the package `googleway` to create the points between origin and
destination and maptools to transform points to lines.

```{r  warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
library(maptools, quietly = T)
library(googleway)
foo <- google_directions(origin = unlist(mydf[1, 2:3]),
                         destination = unlist(mydf[1, 4:5]),
                         key = mykey,
                         mode = "driving",
                         simplify = TRUE)
pl <- decode_pl(foo$routes$overview_polyline$points)
df <- sf::st_as_sf(pl, coords = c("lon", "lat"), crs = 4326)
streets <- list(x = pl$lon, y = pl$lat)
streets <- map2SpatialLines(streets)
plot(streets, axes = T, main= "Route of 133 LDV trips")
```

```{r fgwecho= FALSE, fig.cap="Driving route between zones 'Luz' and 'Bom Retiro' in São Paulo"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figuras/gway.png")
```


#### The R package dodgr

dpdgr[@dodgr] is a new R package with great capbilities. It calculates the 
distance on dual-weight graphs  using priority-queue shorest paths. In order 
to calculate the traffic flows it is necessary the matrix OD for the desired 
mode of transport and the coorodinates of centroids of the OD zones.

The function `dodgr_streetnet` uses the osmdata r package to download street 
network data from Open Street Map [@osm] for the points of the centroids of 
zones OD. Depending on the spatial extent of the data, the  resulting data can 
be large. The function `weight_streetnet` weight the lines from OSM road network 
according to a specific profile of traffic: "psv" for Public Service Vehicle.
"bicycle", nd others. The weights are profile values for the OSM type of roads 
based on this webpage: https://www.routino.org/xml/routino-profiles.xml. The
function `dodgr_vertices` extract the vertices pf thegraph including the 
coordinates. Finally, the function `dodgr_flowmap` reads the graph and plot the 
flows. Belows s an example for São Paulo using the data of ODS the urban uderground 
public transportation system [@ODS].


```{r eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
library(dodgr)
library(magrittr)
xy <- sf::st_read("ZonesODS2007/Zonas2007.TAB",
                  crs = 31983) %>% sf::st_transform(4326) %>%
  sf::st_centroid() %>% sf::st_coordinates()
mm <- read.csv("Tab24_OD2007_coletivo.csv", h = F, sep = ";")
m <- as.matrix(mm)
net <- dodgr_streetnet(pts = xy)
netmc <- weight_streetnet(net,
                          wt_profile = "psv")
verts <- dodgr_vertices (netmc)
pts <- verts$id[match_pts_to_graph(verts, xy)]
netf <- dodgr_flows_aggregate(netmc,
                              from = pts,
                              to = pts,
                              flows = m)

dodgr_flowmap(netm)
```

```{r rdodgr, echo = FALSE, include=TRUE, fig.cap="Daily trips of Light Duty Vehicles in São Paulo", dpi=300, fig.height=18, fig.width=18, fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figuras/dodgr.png", dpi = 300)
```


### Top-down approach

VEIN was designed with traffic flow at street leve on mind, however, it is possible
that user might be inclined for doing for using a top-down approach. Here some
possible causes:

1. Bottom-up approach can demand more computatonal resources for a country or a continent. 
2. Another possibility is that the emissions inventory is going to be used solely for air quality modellign purposes, where the proportion of grid spacing and street is such that spatial detail would be lose, for instance with resolution of 10 km.
3. Also, it is possible that there is no way of obtaining traffic information at street level.
4. Limitated resources, time, funding, human resources, etc.
5. Lastly, due to simplism. It is also possible that the objective simply the 
objective is to estimate an emissions inventory using a top-down approach.

Under these circumstances a top-down approach would be better suited for some users.
As VEIN counts toolkit for estimating emissions, it is reasonable to use all VEIN
resources with a top-down approach.

In this case, the user must follow some considerations:

- Use `inventory` functions in the same way as shown on section \@ref(st).
- Create a network, but instead use a road network with spatial lines, use
spatial polygons. The Spatial polygon might represent some area where the amount
of vehicles is known.
- The `age` functions shown in following sections, show that it is possible to 
apply age distributions to each street, in this case, to each area.

The Fig. \@ref(fig:ftd) shows the emissions of PM for each state Brazil and 
prepared for a congress using VEIN as a top-down tool [@ibarraigac].

```{r ftd, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Emissions of PM due trafifc, 2017"}
UF <- readRDS("~/Documentos/suda/brazil/network/net_pollutant.rds")
plot(UF["PM"], axes = T, main = "Emissions of PM due trafifc, 2017")
```





## Main functions

The Fig.(\@ref(fig:diavein)) shows a complete diagram with the steps for
elaborating an emissions inventory. Also, the function `inventory` shown on
sub-section (\@ref(veinstructure)) shows the functions to structure an inventory.
This and the following subsection of application shows respective the part of the
diagram Fig.(\@ref(fig:diatraffic)) and how to run vein storing the results in the 
directories shown on Fig. (\@ref(st)). 

The first element that the user must have is the traffic at street level. This
is shown as a green circle with the word 'traffic' on Fig. (\@ref(fig:diatraffic)).
The user must use any `age` function which produces objects of class `Vehicles`.
The function `netspeed` produces an object of class `Speed`. This objects are
required by the `emis` function.

```


### Expanding traffic data with the function `temp_fact`

Traffic data must be temporally extrapolated because it is usually available only for the morning rush hour. 
Traffic data can be estimated from short period traffic count datasets, then expanded to represent longer timespan, such as Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT; [@wang2009forecasting, lam2000estimation]). The next step is to extrapolate the vehicular flow at street link $i$, vehicle type $j$, and age of use $k$, to obtain the vehicular flow for hour of the week $l$ ($F_{i,j,k,l}$; see equation 
\@ref(eq:flowx).

\begin{equation}
F_{i,j,k,l} = F^*_{i,j,k} \cdot TF_{j,l}
(\#eq:flowx)
\end{equation}

where $TF_{j,l}$ are the temporal factors varying according  to each hour of
$l$ and type of vehicle $j$.  For instance, $TF$ is defined as a matrix with 24 lines 
and numbers of columns to each day considered, from Monday to Sunday. In order to 
expand traffic to other hours, $TF$ matrices must be normalized to the hour that 
represents the traffic data. It means that $TF$ values at morning peak hour must be 1 
and the respective proportion must be assigned to the other hours. For example, $TF$ values can be obtained from automatic traffic count stations. 

The function `temp_fact` return $F_{i,j,k,l}$ as an object with class `Vehicles`.
The arguments are:

- `q` is a  data-frame of traffic flow to each hour (veh/h) at each street.
- `pro` s a matrix or data-frame to extrapolate .



### Calculating speed at other hours with the function `netspeed`

The average speed of traffic flow is very important and it must be determined for 
each link and hour. Once the vehicular flow is identified for each hour, the 
average speed is then identified for each hour. This was accomplished by employing 
curves from the Bureau of Public Roads (BPR; [@bpr]), as shown in Eq. 
\@ref(eq:bpr). The process involves calculating speed by dividing the length of 
road by the time. The time is calculated using the total traffic expanded to each 
street link $i$ and hour $l$. 

\begin{equation}
T_{i,l} = To_i \cdot \left(1 +\alpha \cdot \left(\dfrac{Q_{i,l}}{C_i}\right)^\beta \right)
(\#eq:bpr)
\end{equation}

The function `netspeed` do this calculations. The arguments of this function
are:

```{r}
args(netspeed)
```

`netspeed` allows basically two types of speeds data-frame which depends on the
availability od data by the user. If the user has `q`, `ps`, `ffs` and `cap` can
use the argument `scheme = FALSE`, or when the user only has `ps` and `ffs`
and use the argument `scheme = TRUE`.

- `q` is a  data-frame of traffic flow to each hour (veh/h) at each street.
- `ps	`is the Peak speed (km/h) at each street.
- `ffs` Free flow speed (km/h) at each street.
- `cap` Capacity of link (veh/h) at each street.
- `lkm` Distance of link (km) of each street.
- `alpha` Parameter of -@bpr curves.
- `beta` Parameter of -@bpr curves.
- `scheme` Logical to create a Speed data-frame with 24 hours and a default profile. It needs `ffs` and `ps` at each street:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
df <- data.frame(
  Period = c("00:00-06:00",
             "06:00-07:00",
             "07:00-10:00",
             "10:00-17:00",
             "17:00-20:00",
             "20:00-22:00",
             "22:00-00:00"),
  Speed = c("ffs (Free flow speed)",
            "average between ffs and ps",
            "ps (Peakspeed)",
            "average between ffs and ps",
            "ps (Peak speed)",
            "average between ffs and ps",
            "ffs (Free flow speed)"))
knitr::kable(df, 
             caption = 'speeds for scheme = T',
             booktabs = TRUE,
             align = "c"
)
```


### Distribution of vehicles by age of use with the functions `age_ldv`, `age_hdv` and `age_moto`


These functions reads traffic data at each street and returns an object of class
`Vehicles`, which is a data-frame with the number of vehicles at each street
and the number of columns represent the amount of vehicles at each age. The
functions `age_moto` and `age_hdv` are identical. These functions apply survival
equations into the fleet from -@MMA2011. The arguments are:

- `x`numerical vector of vehicles at each street.
- `name` word of vehicle assigned to columns of dataframe.
- `a` parameter of survival equation. The default value for `age_ldv` is 1.698
and for `age_hdv` and `age_moto` is 0.2.
- `b` parameter of survival equation.  The default value for `age_ldv` is -0.2
and for `age_hdv` and `age_moto` is 17.
- `agemin` age of newest vehicles for that category. The default value is 1,
however it can be bigger than one when it is a vehicle that is not circulating
more than year ago.
- `agemax` age of oldest vehicles for that category. Teh default value is 50
assuming that the oldest vehicle in circulation has 50 years of use. However,
new type of vehicles will be newer.
- `k` multiplication factor. This factor helps to split the traffic `x` in the
vehicular composition.
- `bystreet` when TRUE it is expecting that `a` and `b` are numeric vectors with length equal to `x`. In other words, the values of `a` and `b` varies in each
street.
- `message` message with average age and total number of vehicles.


### The function `my_age`

These functions also reads traffic data at each street and returns an object of
class `Vehicles`, which is a data-frame with the number of vehicles at each
street and the number of columns represent the amount of vehicles at each age.
However, it is based on data the user has and not by parameters. Therefore,
using this function with own data should produce more representative results.
The arguments are:

```{r}
args(my_age)
```

- `x` numerical vector of vehicles at each street.
- `y` Age dustribution of vehicles. This parameter can be anual sales or anual 
registry for the category of vehicle.
- `name` of vehicle assigned to columns of dataframe.
- `k` multiplication factor. This factor helps to split the traffic `x` in the
vehicular composition.
- `message` message with average age and total numer of vehicles.


### The class `Vehicles`

`Vehicles` is a class in vein, shown in on Fig. (\@ref(fig:diatraffic)). This
class includes the methods `print`, `plot` and `summary`. This means that, 
`Vehicles` objects presents customized versions of  `print`, `plot` and
`summary` in order to make easier to the user to use vein. The figure
\@ref(fig.plotpc) shows a simple plot of a `Vehicles` object, followed by the
`head` of this object. The plot shows the sum of each type of vehicle by age of use, 
with a vertical red line indicating the average age, 11.17 years of use.

```{r plotpc, echo = TRUE}
library(vein)
data(net)
PC_E25 <- age_ldv(x = net$ldv,name = "PC_E25", k = 75/100*37.25, message = F)
plot(PC_E25)
```


```{r headpc, echo = TRUE}
head(PC_E25[, 1:4]) # The first 4 columns
```


### Other traffic functions

Another function is `adt` which calculates average daily traffic (ADT) from
hourly traffic data. This function reads numeric vectors with the amount of
vehicles at each street expand the traffic with temporal factors for each type
of vehicle. The arguemtns are:

```{r}
args(adt)
```

- `pc` numeric vector for passenger cars
- `lcv` numeric vector for light commercial vehicles
- `hgv` numeric vector for heavy good vehicles or trucks
- `bus` numeric vector for bus
- `mc` numeric vector for motorcycles
- `p_pc` data-frame profile for passenger cars
- `p_lcv` data-frame profile for light commercial vehicles
- `p_hgv` data-frame profile for heavy good vehicles or trucks
- `p_bus` data-frame profile for bus
- `p_mc` data-frame profile for motorcycles

## Vehicular composition


## Application

As mentioned above, the application consists in using the travel demand model
for west part of São Paulo city, present in vein. This script reads traffic data
and expand applying an age function. It will be used the `inventory` function
with the default vehicular composition, shown on section (\@red(st)). Please,
use the scripts in the extra material of this book. The base year is 2015 and the
extended example is available in appendix 1.


```{r eval = FALSE}
library(vein)
inventory(file.path(tempdir(), "YourCity"))
setwd("YourCity")
data(net) # Loads the traffic demand simulation for west São Paulo
data(net)
data(pc_profile)
pc_week <- temp_fact(net$ldv+net$hdv, pc_profile)
speed <- netspeed(pc_week, net$ps, net$ffs, net$capacity, net$lkm)
saveRDS(net, file = "network/net.rds")
saveRDS(speed, file = "network/speed.rds")
```
